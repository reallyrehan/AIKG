The core ofthis network model consists of four parts, namely, an encoder network, amultiple max-pooling integration module, a cross multiscale deconvolutiondecoder network and a pixel-level classification layer. In the networkstructure of the encoder, we use multiscale convolution instead of thetraditional single-channel convolution. The multiple max-pooling integrationmodule first integrates the output features of each submodule of the encodernetwork and reduces the number of parameters by convolution using a kernel sizeof 1. At the same time, each max-pooling layer (the pooling size of each layeris different) is spliced after each convolution to achieve the translationinvariance of the feature maps of each submodule. We use the output featuremaps from the multiple max-pooling integration module as the input of thedecoder network; the multiscale convolution of each submodule in the decodernetwork is cross-fused with the feature maps generated by the correspondingmultiscale convolution in the encoder network. Using the above feature mapprocessing methods solves the sparsity problem after the max-poolinglayer-generating matrix and enhances the robustness of the classification.

To measure thetransmission matrix, the individual modes of the multimode fiber are excitedsequentially at the input and a mode decomposition is performed at the output.Mode decomposition is usually performed using digital holography, whichrequires the provision of a reference wave and leads to high efforts. Toovercome these drawbacks, a neural network is proposed, which performs modedecomposition with intensity-only camera recordings of the multimode fiberfacet.

In this work, it could be shown forthe first time that by using a DenseNet with 121 layers it is possible to breakthrough the hurdle of 6 modes. The advancement is demonstrated by a modedecomposition with 10 modes experimentally. The training process is based onsynthetic data.

To this end, we first introduce aninception FPN in which each layer contains convolution filters with differentkernel sizes to enlarge the receptive field and integrate more usefulinformation.

Specifically, we takeconvolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet orMNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradientascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class.It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNsbelieve with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call \"foolingimages\" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light oninteresting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raisequestions about the generality of DNN computer vision.", "authors": ["Anh Nguyen", "Jason Yosinski", "Jeff Clune"], "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.NE"]}

In these methods, the low resolution (LR)input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a singlefilter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means thatthe super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstratethat this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, wepresent the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNNarchitecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition,we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array ofupscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. Bydoing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SRpipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for eachfeature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overallSR operation.

Following recent approaches,we first predict the 2D projections of 3D points related to the target objectand then compute the 3D pose from these correspondences using a geometricmethod. Unfortunately, as the results of our experiments show, predicting these2D projections using a regular CNN or a Convolutional Pose Machine is highlysensitive to partial occlusions, even when these methods are trained withpartially occluded examples. Our solution is to predict heatmaps from multiplesmall patches independently and to accumulate the results to obtain accurateand robust predictions.

First,it uses a metric learning approach to train the source model on the sourcedataset by optimizing the triplet loss function. This results in clusters whereembeddings of the same label are close to each other and those with differentlabels are far from one another.

It aims at identifyingregional wall motions into one of the four types including normal, hypokinetic,akinetic, and dyskinetic, and is extremely challenging due to the complexmyocardium deformation and subtle inter-class difference of motion patterns.All existing work on automated motion analysis are focused on binaryabnormality detection to avoid the much more demanding motion scoring, which isurgently required in real clinical practice yet has never been investigatedbefore. In this work, we propose Cardiac-MOS, the first powerful method forcardiac motion scoring from cardiac MR sequences based on deep convolutionneural network. Due to the locality of convolution, the relationship betweendistant non-local responses of the feature map cannot be explored, which isclosely related to motion difference between segments. In Cardiac-MOS, suchnon-local relationship is modeled with non-local neural network within eachsegment and across all segments of one subject, i.e., segment- andsubject-level non-local modeling, and lead to obvious performance improvement.Besides, Cardiac-MOS can effectively extract motion information from MRsequences of various lengths by interpolating the convolution kernel along thetemporal dimension, therefore can be applied to MR sequences of multiplesources.

We develop a method for S+U learning that usesan adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), butwith synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several keymodifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoidartifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) alocal adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history ofrefined images.

The development of computer-aided systems based on deepneural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detectCOVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited innumber, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, thevulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs arevulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, wefocus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chestX-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simpleiterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failureresulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The resultsdemonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the averagenorm of an image in the image dataset achieves &gt;85% and &gt;90% success rates forthe nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargetedUAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. Thetargeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a giventarget class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required inpractical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, theyemphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns.

TraditionalSDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems, with the most criticalsub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved usingiterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC), which is time-consuming.However, FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather thaniterative hash code-solving step, which is highly efficient. Furthermore, FSDHis usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squaresregression, making FSDH generally faster than SDH.

Keeping this inmind, we propose Mimic and Fool, a task agnostic adversarial attack. Given afeature extractor, the proposed attack finds an adversarial image which canmimic the image feature of the original image. This ensures that the two imagesgive the same (or similar) output regardless of the task. We randomly select1000 MSCOCO validation images for experimentation. We perform experiments ontwo image captioning models, Show and Tell, Show Attend and Tell and one VQAmodel, namely, end-to-end neural module network (N2NMN). The proposed attackachieves success rate of 74.0%, 81.0% and 87.1% for Show and Tell, Show Attendand Tell and N2NMN respectively.

Unlike the widely-used neural module networks in visualQ\\&amp;A, where the language (ie, question) is fully observable, CNM for captioningis more challenging as the language is being generated and thus is partiallyobservable. To this end, we make the following technical contributions for CNMtraining: 1) compact module design --- one for function words and three forvisual content words (eg, noun, adjective, and verb), 2) soft module fusion andmulti-step module execution, robustifying the visual reasoning in partialobservation, 3) a linguistic loss for module controller being faithful topart-of-speech collocations (eg, adjective is before noun). Extensiveexperiments on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark validate theeffectiveness of our CNM image captioner. In particular, CNM achieves a newstate-of-the-art 127.9 CIDEr-D on Karpathy split and a single-model 126.0 c40on the official server.

In addition to the challenges found in visualquestion answering (VQA), which can be seen as one-round dialog, visual dialogencompasses several more. We focus on one such problem called visualcoreference resolution that involves determining which words, typically nounphrases and pronouns, co-refer to the same entity/object instance in an image.This is crucial, especially for pronouns (e.g., `it'), as the dialog agent mustfirst link it to a previous coreference (e.g., `boat'), and only then can relyon the visual grounding of the coreference `boat' to reason about the pronoun`it'. Prior work (in visual dialog) models visual coreference resolution either(a) implicitly via a memory network over history, or (b) at a coarse level forthe entire question; and not explicitly at a phrase level of granularity. Inthis work, we propose a neural module network architecture for visual dialog byintroducing two novel modules - Refer and Exclude - that perform explicit,grounded, coreference resolution at a finer word level. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our model on MNIST Dialog, a visually simple yetcoreference-wise complex dataset, by achieving near perfect accuracy, and onVisDial, a large and challenging visual dialog dataset on real images, whereour model outperforms other approaches, and is more interpretable, grounded,and consistent qualitatively.", "authors": ["Satwik Kottur", "Jos\u00e9 M.

We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual QuestionAnswering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balancethe popular VQA dataset by collecting complementary images such that everyquestion in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image,but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to thequestion. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQAdataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Ourcomplete balanced dataset is publicly available at www.visualqa.org as part ofthe 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQAv2.0).  We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanceddataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset,suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors.This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems tobe a qualitative sense among practitioners.  Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary imagesenables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition toproviding an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides acounter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that issimilar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to thesame question.

In thiswork, we propose to overcome the SSS problem in re-id distance metric learningby matching people in a discriminative null space of the training data. In thisnull space, images of the same person are collapsed into a single point thusminimising the within-class scatter to the extreme and maximising the relativebetween-class separation simultaneously.

This paradox of high-quality detection has twocauses: 1) overfitting, due to vanishing positive samples for large thresholds,and 2) inference-time quality mismatch between detector and test hypotheses. Amulti-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, composed of asequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, is proposed toaddress these problems.

However, state-of-the-art PAM faces a tradeoff between imaging speedand spatial sampling density within the same field-of-view (FOV). Limited bythe pulsed laser's repetition rate, the imaging speed is inversely proportionalto the total number of effective pixels. To cover the same FOV in a shorteramount of time with the same PAM hardware, there is currently no other optionthan to decrease spatial sampling density (i.e., sparse sampling). Deeplearning methods have recently been used to improve sparsely sampled PAMimages; however, these methods often require time-consuming pre-training and alarge training dataset that has fully sampled, co-registered ground truth.

However,only limited and sparse point clouds can be provided by the 16 channels LiDAR,which cannot guarantee sufficient positioning accuracy for ADV in challengingdynamic environments. The high-resolution image from the low-cost camera canprovide ample information about the surroundings. However, the explicit depthinformation is not available from the image. Inspired by the complementarinessof 3D LiDAR and camera, this paper proposes to make use of the high-resolutionimages from a camera to enrich the raw 3D point clouds from the low-cost 16channels LiDAR based on a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm.

Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design andimprove mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balancethese trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities toconsider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecturesearch (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into themain objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a goodtrade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency isconsidered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approachdirectly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobilephones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and searchspace size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space thatencourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results showthat our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN modelsacross multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNetachieves 75.2% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8xfaster than MobileNetV2 [29] with 0.5% higher accuracy and 2.3x faster thanNASNet [36] with 1.2% higher accuracy.

The central task of facerecognition, including face verification and identification, involves facefeature discrimination. However, the traditional softmax loss of deep CNNsusually lacks the power of discrimination. To address this problem, recentlyseveral loss functions such as center loss, large margin softmax loss, andangular softmax loss have been proposed. All these improved losses share thesame idea: maximizing inter-class variance and minimizing intra-class variance.In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely large margin cosineloss (LMCL), to realize this idea from a different perspective. Morespecifically, we reformulate the softmax loss as a cosine loss by $L_2$normalizing both features and weight vectors to remove radial variations, basedon which a cosine margin term is introduced to further maximize the decisionmargin in the angular space. As a result, minimum intra-class variance andmaximum inter-class variance are achieved by virtue of normalization and cosinedecision margin maximization.

We explore three aspectsof the problem in the context of finding small faces: the role of scaleinvariance, image resolution, and contextual reasoning. While most recognitionapproaches aim to be scale-invariant, the cues for recognizing a 3px tall faceare fundamentally different than those for recognizing a 300px tall face. Wetake a different approach and train separate detectors for different scales. Tomaintain efficiency, detectors are trained in a multi-task fashion: they makeuse of features extracted from multiple layers of single (deep) featurehierarchy. While training detectors for large objects is straightforward, thecrucial challenge remains training detectors for small objects. We show thatcontext is crucial, and define templates that make use of massively-largereceptive fields (where 99% of the template extends beyond the object ofinterest). Finally, we explore the role of scale in pre-trained deep networks,providing ways to extrapolate networks tuned for limited scales to ratherextreme ranges.

(ii) The Kineticsdataset has sufficient data for training of deep 3D CNNs, and enables trainingof up to 152 ResNets layers, interestingly similar to 2D ResNets on ImageNet.ResNeXt-101 achieved 78.4% average accuracy on the Kinetics test set.

In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weightTransformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all theinteractions between multiple such inputs in visual dialog.

However, studyingthese subtasks in isolation on large, real datasets is infeasible as itrequires prohibitively-expensive complete annotation of the 'state' of allimages and dialogs.  We develop CLEVR-Dialog, a large diagnostic dataset for studying multi-roundreasoning in visual dialog. Specifically, we construct a dialog grammar that isgrounded in the scene graphs of the images from the CLEVR dataset. Thiscombination results in a dataset where all aspects of the visual dialog arefully annotated. In total, CLEVR-Dialog contains 5 instances of 10-rounddialogs for about 85k CLEVR images, totaling to 4.25M question-answer pairs.  We use CLEVR-Dialog to benchmark performance of standard visual dialogmodels; in particular, on visual coreference resolution (as a function of thecoreference distance). This is the first analysis of its kind for visual dialogmodels that was not possible without this dataset.

Theeffectiveness of ordinary source separation methods based on statistical modelssuch as ICA and NMF depends on the analysis window size and cannot handlereverberation environments. To address these limitations, a short-term sourceseparation method based on a temporal convolutional network in combination withcompact bilinear pooling is presented. The proposed scheme is virtuallyindependent of the analysis window size and does not lose effectiveness whenthe analysis window is shortened to 1.6s, which in turn is very interesting totackle the source separation problem in time-varying scenarios. Also,improvements in WER as high as 80% were obtained when compared to ICA and NMFwith multi-condition reverberant training and testing, and with time-varyingSNR experiments to simulate a moving target speech source. Finally, theexperiment with the estimation of the clean signal employing the proposedscheme and a clean trained ASR provided a WER 13% lower than the one obtainedwith the corrupted signal and a multi-condition trained ASR.

Unfortunately, existing PEIR methodsalways directly use linear decision function to fuse the features extractedfrom two corresponding egocentric videos, which ignore consistency ofinteraction in paired egocentric videos. The consistency of interactions inpaired videos, and features extracted from them are correlated to each other.On top of that, we propose to build the relevance between two views usingbiliear pooling, which capture the consistency of two views in feature-level.Specifically, each neuron in the feature maps from one view connects to theneurons from another view, which guarantee the compact consistency between twoviews.

Recently, theiterative polynomial approximation method for the matrix square root of acovariance feature was proposed, and resulted in a faster and more stabletraining than the methods based on singular-value decomposition.

Instead of thestandard minimization of an objective function at each pyramid level, we trainone deep network per level to compute the flow update. Unlike the recentFlowNet approach, the networks do not need to deal with large motions; theseare dealt with by the pyramid. This has several advantages. First, our SpatialPyramid Network (SPyNet) is much simpler and 96% smaller than FlowNet in termsof model parameters. This makes it more efficient and appropriate for embeddedapplications. Second, since the flow at each pyramid level is small (&lt; 1pixel), a convolutional approach applied to pairs of warped images isappropriate. Third, unlike FlowNet, the learned convolution filters appearsimilar to classical spatio-temporal filters, giving insight into the methodand how to improve it.

However, they are still rarelydeployed on battery-powered mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearablegadgets, where vision algorithms can enable many revolutionary real-worldapplications. The key limiting factor is the high energy consumption of CNNprocessing due to its high computational complexity. While there are manyprevious efforts that try to reduce the CNN model size or amount ofcomputation, we find that they do not necessarily result in lower energyconsumption, and therefore do not serve as a good metric for energy costestimation.  To close the gap between CNN design and energy consumption optimization, wepropose an energy-aware pruning algorithm for CNNs that directly uses energyconsumption estimation of a CNN to guide the pruning process. The energyestimation methodology uses parameters extrapolated from actual hardwaremeasurements that target realistic battery-powered system setups. The proposedlayer-by-layer pruning algorithm also prunes more aggressively than previouslyproposed pruning methods by minimizing the error in output feature maps insteadof filter weights. For each layer, the weights are first pruned and thenlocally fine-tuned with a closed-form least-square solution to quickly restorethe accuracy. After all layers are pruned, the entire network is furtherglobally fine-tuned using back-propagation. With the proposed pruning method,the energy consumption of AlexNet and GoogLeNet are reduced by 3.7x and 1.6x,respectively, with less than 1% top-5 accuracy loss.

We introduce a simple but powerful approachto computing descriptors for object views that efficiently capture both theobject identity and 3D pose. By contrast with previous manifold-basedapproaches, we can rely on the Euclidean distance to evaluate the similaritybetween descriptors, and therefore use scalable Nearest Neighbor search methodsto efficiently handle a large number of objects under a large range of poses.To achieve this, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to compute thesedescriptors by enforcing simple similarity and dissimilarity constraintsbetween the descriptors. We show that our constraints nicely untangle theimages from different objects and different views into clusters that are notonly well-separated but also structured as the corresponding sets of poses: TheEuclidean distance between descriptors is large when the descriptors are fromdifferent objects, and directly related to the distance between the poses whenthe descriptors are from the same object. These important properties allow usto outperform state-of-the-art object views representations on challenging RGBand RGB-D data.", "authors": ["Paul Wohlhart", "Vincent Lepetit"], "categories": ["cs.CV"]}

In contrast, we propose toattend to the instances with dynamic conditional convolutions. Instead of usinginstance-wise ROIs as inputs to the instance mask head of fixed weights, wedesign dynamic instance-aware mask heads, conditioned on the instances to bepredicted.

For a large-vocabularyclassifier, the chance of obtaining noisy logits is much higher, which caneasily lead to a wrong recognition. In this paper, we exploit prior knowledgeof the relations among object categories to cluster fine-grained classes intocoarser parent classes, and construct a classification tree that is responsiblefor parsing an object instance into a fine-grained category via its parentclass. In the classification tree, as the number of parent class nodes aresignificantly less, their logits are less noisy and can be utilized to suppressthe wrong/noisy logits existed in the fine-grained class nodes. As the way toconstruct the parent class is not unique, we further build multiple trees toform a classification forest where each tree contributes its vote to thefine-grained classification.

In the first task, I compare three populargroups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, andword-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generallyyield better lexicons than the last two groups.

Mostprior work addressing this problem have focused on detecting medium to largefields, while there is strong evidence that around 40\\% of the fieldsworld-wide and 70% of the fields in Asia and Africa are small. The lack ofadequate labeled images for small fields, huge variations in their color,texture, and shape, and faint boundary lines separating them make it difficultto develop an end-to-end learning model for detecting such fields. Hence, inthis paper, we present a multi-stage approach that uses a combination ofmachine learning and image processing techniques. In the first stage, weleverage state-of-the-art edge detection algorithms such as holistically-nestededge detection (HED) to extract first-level contours and polygons. In thesecond stage, we propose image-processing techniques to identify polygons thatare non-fields, over-segmentations, or noise and eliminate them. The next stagetackles under-segmentations using a combination of a novel ``cut-point'' basedtechnique and localized second-level edge detection to obtain individualparcels. Since a few small, non-cropped but vegetated or constructed pocketscan be interspersed in areas that are predominantly croplands, in the finalstage, we train a classifier for identifying each parcel from the previousstage as an agricultural field or not.

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as aclassifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found thatthis loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during thelearning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper theLeast Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the leastsquares loss for both the discriminator and the generator. We show thatminimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson$\\chi^2$ divergence. We also show that the derived objective function thatyields minimizing the Pearson $\\chi^2$ divergence performs better than theclassical one of using least squares for classification. There are two benefitsof LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher qualityimages than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stably during thelearning process. For evaluating the image quality, we conduct both qualitativeand quantitative experiments, and the experimental results show that LSGANs cangenerate higher quality images than regular GANs. Furthermore, we evaluate thestability of LSGANs in two groups. One is to compare between LSGANs and regularGANs without gradient penalty. We conduct three experiments, including Gaussianmixture distribution, difficult architectures, and a newly proposed method ---datasets with small variability, to illustrate the stability of LSGANs.

Thisprocess is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of thealgorithm, if an object lies within the predefined overlap threshold, it leadsto a miss. To this end, we propose Soft-NMS, an algorithm which decays thedetection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlapwith M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process. Soft-NMS obtainsconsistent improvements for the coco-style mAP metric on standard datasets likePASCAL VOC 2007 (1.7% for both R-FCN and Faster-RCNN) and MS-COCO (1.3% forR-FCN and 1.1% for Faster-RCNN) by just changing the NMS algorithm without anyadditional hyper-parameters. Using Deformable-RFCN, Soft-NMS improvesstate-of-the-art in object detection from 39.8% to 40.9% with a single model.Further, the computational complexity of Soft-NMS is the same as traditionalNMS and hence it can be efficiently implemented. Since Soft-NMS does notrequire any extra training and is simple to implement, it can be easilyintegrated into any object detection pipeline.

Our framework first integrates multi-level feature maps intomultiple resolutions, which simultaneously incorporate coarse semantics andfine details. Then it adaptively learns to combine these feature maps at eachresolution and predict saliency maps with the combined features. Finally, thepredicted results are efficiently fused to generate the final saliency map.

State-of-the-art object objectors relyheavily on the off-the-shelf networks pre-trained on large-scale classificationdatasets like ImageNet, which incurs learning bias due to the difference onboth the loss functions and the category distributions between classificationand detection tasks. Model fine-tuning for the detection task could alleviatethis bias to some extent but not fundamentally. Besides, transferringpre-trained models from classification to detection between discrepant domainsis even more difficult (e.g. RGB to depth images). A better solution to tacklethese two critical problems is to train object detectors from scratch, whichmotivates our proposed DSOD. Previous efforts in this direction mostly faileddue to much more complicated loss functions and limited training data in objectdetection. In DSOD, we contribute a set of design principles for trainingobject detectors from scratch. One of the key findings is that deepsupervision, enabled by dense layer-wise connections, plays a critical role inlearning a good detector. Combining with several other principles, we developDSOD following the single-shot detection (SSD) framework. Experiments on PASCALVOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that DSOD can achieve betterresults than the state-of-the-art solutions with much more compact models.

In this paper, we extend adversarialexamples to semantic segmentation and object detection which are much moredifficult.

Based on this idea, we propose a novelalgorithm named Dense Adversary Generation (DAG), which generates a largefamily of adversarial examples, and applies to a wide range of state-of-the-artdeep networks for segmentation and detection. We also find that the adversarialperturbations can be transferred across networks with different training data,based on different architectures, and even for different recognition tasks.

The comparison with isochrones shows that while the oldestpopulation is approximately coeval in all fields, the age of the youngestpopulations increases with increasing radius. Low-resolution spectroscopy inthe infrared CaII triplet region has been obtained for about 150 stars near thetip red giant branch in the same fields.

The metal content of the most metal-poor objects, which are also theoldest according to the derived age-metallicity relationships, is similar inall fields independently of the radius.

This limitation severelyconstrains our understanding of galaxy formation. For example, the largestgalaxy in the Local Group, Andromeda, offers an ideal laboratory for studyingthe formation of large spiral galaxies, but the galaxy shows substructure on avariety of scales, presumably due to its violent merger history. Within itsremaining lifetime, HST can only sample a few sight-lines through this complexgalaxy. In contrast, a wide field imager could provide a map of Andromeda'shalo, outer disk, and tidal streams, revealing the spatially-dependent starformation history in each structure. The same data would enable many secondarystudies, such as the age variation in Andromeda's globular cluster system,gigantic samples of variable stars, and microlensing tracers of the galaxy'sdark matter distribution.", "authors": ["Thomas M.

Our observational approach is based on deepcolor-magnitude diagrams, that provides accurate distances, surface brightnessand the properties of stellar population of the studied region of this tidalstream. The derived distances for these tidal debris wraps are 45 kpc and 54kpc respectively.We also confirm these detections with numerical simulations ofthe Sagittarius dwarf plus the Milky Way. The model reproduces the presentposition and velocity of the Sagittarius main body and presents a long tidalstream formed by tidal interaction with the Milky Way potential. This model isalso in good agreement with the available observations of the Sagittarius tidalstream. We also present a method for estimating the shape of the Milky Way halopotential using numerical simulations. From our simulations we obtain anoblateness of the Milky Way dark halo potential of 0.85, using the currentdatabase of distances and radial velocities of the Sagittarius tidal stream.The color-magnitude diagram of the apocenter of Sagittarius shows that thisregion of the stream shares the complex star formation history observed in themain body of the galaxy. We present the first evidence for a gradient in thestellar population along the stream, possibly correlated with its differentpericenter passages. (abridged)", "authors": ["D. Martinez-Delgado", "M.

This is a challenging problem due to the largediscrepancy between online shopping images, usually taken in ideallighting/pose/background conditions, and user photos captured in uncontrolledconditions. To address this problem, we propose a Dual Attribute-aware RankingNetwork (DARN) for retrieval feature learning. More specifically, DARN consistsof two sub-networks, one for each domain, whose retrieval featurerepresentations are driven by semantic attribute learning. We show that thisattribute-guided learning is a key factor for retrieval accuracy improvement.In addition, to further align with the nature of the retrieval problem, weimpose a triplet visual similarity constraint for learning to rank across thetwo sub-networks. Another contribution of our work is a large-scale datasetwhich makes the network learning feasible. We exploit customer review websitesto crawl a large set of online shopping images and corresponding offline userphotos with fine-grained clothing attributes, i.e., around 450,000 onlineshopping images and about 90,000 exact offline counterpart images of thoseonline ones. All these images are collected from real-world consumer websitesreflecting the diversity of the data modality, which makes this dataset uniqueand rare in the academic community. We extensively evaluate the retrievalperformance of networks in different configurations.

A new cascade design procedure isintroduced, by formulating cascade learning as the Lagrangian optimization of arisk that accounts for both accuracy and complexity. A boosting algorithm,denoted as complexity aware cascade training (CompACT), is then derived tosolve this optimization. CompACT cascades are shown to seek an optimaltrade-off between accuracy and complexity by pushing features of highercomplexity to the later cascade stages, where only a few difficult candidatepatches remain to be classified. This enables the use of features of vastlydifferent complexities in a single detector. In result, the feature pool can beexpanded to features previously impractical for cascade design, such as theresponses of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This is demonstratedthrough the design of a pedestrian detector with a pool of features whosecomplexities span orders of magnitude. The resulting cascade generalizes thecombination of a CNN with an object proposal mechanism: rather than apre-processing stage, CompACT cascades seamlessly integrate CNNs in theirstages.

We first use segmentation to detect the objects of interestin 2D even in presence of partial occlusions and cluttered background. Bycontrast with recent patch-based methods, we rely on a \"holistic\" approach: Weapply to the detected objects a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained topredict their 3D poses in the form of 2D projections of the corners of their 3Dbounding boxes. This, however, is not sufficient for handling objects from therecent T-LESS dataset: These objects exhibit an axis of rotational symmetry,and the similarity of two images of such an object under two different posesmakes training the CNN challenging. We solve this problem by restricting therange of poses used for training, and by introducing a classifier to identifythe range of a pose at run-time before estimating it. We also use an optionaladditional step that refines the predicted poses. We improve thestate-of-the-art on the LINEMOD dataset from 73.7% to 89.3% of correctlyregistered RGB frames.

To address this problem, thispaper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over inputframes using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1Dkernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our methoddevelops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input framesand estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since ourmethod is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame atonce, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neuralnetwork to produce visually pleasing frames.

Current systems often assume the availability ofmultiple facial images (sometimes from the same subject) as input, and mustaddress a number of methodological challenges such as establishing densecorrespondences across large facial poses, expressions, and non-uniformillumination. In general these methods require complex and inefficientpipelines for model building and fitting. In this work, we propose to addressmany of these limitations by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) onan appropriate dataset consisting of 2D images and 3D facial models or scans.Our CNN works with just a single 2D facial image, does not require accuratealignment nor establishes dense correspondence between images, works forarbitrary facial poses and expressions, and can be used to reconstruct thewhole 3D facial geometry (including the non-visible parts of the face)bypassing the construction (during training) and fitting (during testing) of a3D Morphable Model.

With character candidates detected by cascade boosting, themin-cost flow network model integrates the last three sequential steps into asingle process which solves the error accumulation problem at both characterlevel and text line level effectively. The proposed technique has been testedon three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset and amultilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on allthree datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on themultilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for thedetection of texts in different languages.", "authors": ["Shangxuan Tian", "Yifeng Pan", "Chang Huang", "Shijian Lu", "Kai Yu", "Chew Lim Tan"], "categories": ["cs.CV"]}

However, to train CNNs requires aconsiderable amount of data, which is difficult to collect and laborious toannotate. Recent advances in computer graphics make it possible to train CNNson photo-realistic synthetic imagery with computer-generated annotations.Despite this, the domain mismatch between the real images and the syntheticdata cripples the models' performance. Hence, we propose a curriculum-stylelearning approach to minimize the domain gap in urban scenery semanticsegmentation. The curriculum domain adaptation solves easy tasks first to infernecessary properties about the target domain; in particular, the first task isto learn global label distributions over images and local distributions overlandmark superpixels. These are easy to estimate because images of urban sceneshave strong idiosyncrasies (e.g., the size and spatial relations of buildings,streets, cars, etc.). We then train a segmentation network while regularizingits predictions in the target domain to follow those inferred properties.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to help answerthese types of questions. The main idea of this framework is to learn a featuretransformation from images of items into a latent space that expressescompatibility. For the feature transformation, we use a Siamese ConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) architecture, where training examples are pairs of itemsthat are either compatible or incompatible. We model compatibility based onco-occurrence in large-scale user behavior data; in particular co-purchase datafrom Amazon.com. To learn cross-category fit, we introduce a strategic methodto sample training data, where pairs of items are heterogeneous dyads, i.e.,the two elements of a pair belong to different high-level categories.

Different fromtraditional closed set learning, CIL has two main challenges: 1) Novel classdetection. The initial training data only contains incomplete classes, andstreaming test data will accept unknown classes. Therefore, the model needs tonot only accurately classify known classes, but also effectively detect unknownclasses; 2) Model expansion. After the novel classes are detected, the modelneeds to be updated without re-training using entire previous data. However,traditional CIL methods have not fully considered these two challenges, first,they are always restricted to single novel class detection each phase andembedding confusion caused by unknown classes. Besides, they also ignore thecatastrophic forgetting of known categories in model update. To this end, wepropose a Class-Incremental Learning without Forgetting (CILF) framework, whichaims to learn adaptive embedding for processing novel class detection and modelupdate in a unified framework. In detail, CILF designs to regularizeclassification with decoupled prototype based loss, which can improve theintra-class and inter-class structure significantly, and acquire a compactembedding representation for novel class detection in result. Then, CILFemploys a learnable curriculum clustering operator to estimate the number ofsemantic clusters via fine-tuning the learned network, in which curriculumoperator can adaptively learn the embedding in self-taught form. Therefore,CILF can detect multiple novel classes and mitigate the embedding confusionproblem.

The replay processes makepossible a compromise between optimizing the current learning objective and thepast ones enabling learning without forgetting in sequences of tasks settings.We show that they are very promising methods for continual learning.

In this work, we considerthe more realistic scenario where the users have only unlabeled data and theserver has a limited amount of labeled data. In this semi-supervised federatedlearning (ssfl) setting, the data distribution can be non-iid, in the sense ofdifferent distributions of classes at different users. We define a metric, $R$,to measure this non-iidness in class distributions. In this setting, we providea thorough study on different factors that can affect the final test accuracy,including algorithm design (such as training objective), the non-iidness $R$,the communication period $T$, the number of users $K$, the amount of labeleddata in the server $N_s$, and the number of users $C_k\\leq K$ that communicatewith the server in each communication round. We evaluate our ssfl framework onCifar-10, SVHN, and EMNIST.

These advances come with practicalchallenges: for instance, batch normalization ties the prediction of individualexamples with other examples within a batch, resulting in a network that isheavily dependent on batch size. Layer normalization and group normalizationare data-dependent and thus must be continually used, even at test-time. Toaddress the issues that arise from using explicit normalization techniques, wepropose to replace existing normalization methods with a simple, secondaryobjective loss that we term a standardization loss. This formulation isflexible and robust across different batch sizes and surprisingly, thissecondary objective accelerates learning on the primary training objective.Because it is a training loss, it is simply removed at test-time, and nofurther effort is needed to maintain normalized activations. We find that astandardization loss accelerates training on both small- and large-scale imageclassification experiments, works with a variety of architectures, and islargely robust to training across different batch sizes.", "authors": ["Jasmine Collins", "Johannes Balle", "Jonathon Shlens"], "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"]}

Segmentation methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)can out-perform conventional methods in terms of both accuracy and levels ofautomation. One common issue in training a DCNN for biomedical semanticsegmentation is the internal covariate shift where the training ofconvolutional kernels is encumbered by the distribution change of inputfeatures, hence both the training speed and performance are decreased. BatchNormalization (BN) is the first proposed method for addressing internalcovariate shift and is widely used. Instance Normalization (IN) and LayerNormalization (LN) have also been proposed. Group Normalization (GN) isproposed more recently and has not yet been applied to 2D biomedical semanticsegmentation, however, no specific validations on GN were given. Most DCNNs forbiomedical semantic segmentation adopt BN as the normalization method bydefault, without reviewing its performance. In this paper, four normalizationmethods - BN, IN, LN and GN are compared in details, specifically for 2Dbiomedical semantic segmentation. U-Net is adopted as the basic DCNN structure.Three datasets regarding the Right Ventricle (RV), aorta, and Left Ventricle(LV) are used for the validation.

Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred frompre-training to fine-tuning.

We assumea two-groups normal mixture model for the data and consider the asymptoticframework adopted in Bogdan et al.

We establish that within our chosen asymptoticframework, the multiple testing rules under study asymptotically attain therisk of the Bayes Oracle up to a multiplicative factor, with the constant inthe risk close to the constant in the Oracle risk. This is similar to a resultobtained in Datta and Ghosh (2013) for the multiple testing rule based on thehorseshoe estimator introduced in Carvalho et al. (2009, 2010).

In particular, their B-V colors at maximumbrightness are found to be on average redder by ~0.1, suggesting that theyeither are associated with dusty environments or have intrinsically red B-Vcolors. The HV SNe Ia are also found to prefer a lower extinction ratio Rv~1.6(versus ~2.4 for the Normal ones). Applying such an absorption-correctiondichotomy to SNe Ia of these two groups remarkably reduces the dispersion intheir peak luminosity from 0.178 mag to only 0.125 mag.", "authors": ["Xiaofeng Wang", "A.

However, itscomputational cost remains high, even unreachable under modest computationalsettings. Affording SMBO with weight-sharing alleviates this problem. On theother hand, progressive search with SMBO is inherently greedy, as it leveragesa learned surrogate function to predict the validation error of neuralarchitectures. This prediction is directly used to rank the sampled neuralarchitectures. We propose to attenuate the greediness of the original SMBOmethod by relaxing the role of the surrogate function so it predictsarchitecture sampling probability instead.

Although recent deep learning object detectors suchas Fast/Faster R-CNN [1, 2] have shown excellent performance for general objectdetection, they have limited success for detecting pedestrian, and previousleading pedestrian detectors were in general hybrid methods combininghand-crafted and deep convolutional features. In this paper, we investigateissues involving Faster R-CNN [2] for pedestrian detection. We discover thatthe Region Proposal Network (RPN) in Faster R-CNN indeed performs well as astand-alone pedestrian detector, but surprisingly, the downstream classifierdegrades the results. We argue that two reasons account for the unsatisfactoryaccuracy: (i) insufficient resolution of feature maps for handling smallinstances, and (ii) lack of any bootstrapping strategy for mining hard negativeexamples. Driven by these observations, we propose a very simple but effectivebaseline for pedestrian detection, using an RPN followed by boosted forests onshared, high-resolution convolutional feature maps. We comprehensively evaluatethis method on several benchmarks (Caltech, INRIA, ETH, and KITTI), presentingcompetitive accuracy and good speed.

A prerequisite of part discovery is thateach part should be well located. Instead of using external cues, e.g., poseestimation, to directly locate parts, this paper lays emphasis on the contentconsistency within each part.  Specifically, we target at learning discriminative part-informed features forperson retrieval and make two contributions. (i) A network named Part-basedConvolutional Baseline (PCB).

With a uniform partitionstrategy, PCB achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods,proving itself as a strong convolutional baseline for person retrieval.

However, generalized pixel-level anticipation incomputer vision systems is difficult because machine learning struggles withthe ambiguity inherent in predicting the future.

We propose a conditional variational autoencoder as a solutionto this problem. In this framework, direct inference from the image shapes thedistribution of possible trajectories, while latent variables encode anynecessary information that is not available in the image. We show that ourmethod is able to successfully predict events in a wide variety of scenes andcan produce multiple different predictions when the future is ambiguous.

To succeed withsuch tasks, computer vision methods need to be trained from real and diverseexamples of our daily dynamic scenes. While most of such scenes are notparticularly exciting, they typically do not appear on YouTube, in movies or TVbroadcasts. So how do we collect sufficiently many diverse but boring samplesrepresenting our lives? We propose a novel Hollywood in Homes approach tocollect such data. Instead of shooting videos in the lab, we ensure diversityby distributing and crowdsourcing the whole process of video creation fromscript writing to video recording and annotation. Following this procedure wecollect a new dataset, Charades, with hundreds of people recording videos intheir own homes, acting out casual everyday activities. The dataset is composedof 9,848 annotated videos with an average length of 30 seconds, showingactivities of 267 people from three continents. Each video is annotated bymultiple free-text descriptions, action labels, action intervals and classes ofinteracted objects. In total, Charades provides 27,847 video descriptions,66,500 temporally localized intervals for 157 action classes and 41,104 labelsfor 46 object classes. Using this rich data, we evaluate and provide baselineresults for several tasks including action recognition and automaticdescription generation.

In thispaper, we revisit the intrinsic linearity of CAM w.r.t. the activation maps.Focusing on the linearity, we construct an explanation model as a linearfunction of binary variables which denote the existence of the correspondingactivation maps. With this approach, the explanation model can be determined bythe class of additive feature attribution methods which adopts SHAP values as aunified measure of feature importance. We then demonstrate the efficacy of theSHAP values as the weight coefficients for CAM. However, the exact SHAP valuesare incalculable.

We propose a novel lossfunction based on sampling and reinforcement learning that learns to generatesentences that realize a global sentence property, such as class specificity.Our results on a fine-grained bird species classification dataset show that ourmodel is able to generate explanations which are not only consistent with animage but also more discriminative than descriptions produced by existingcaptioning methods.", "authors": ["Lisa Anne Hendricks", "Zeynep Akata", "Marcus Rohrbach", "Jeff Donahue", "Bernt Schiele", "Trevor Darrell"], "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"]}

In this paper, we propose a novelinteractive binary image segmentation method based on the Markov Random Field(MRF) framework and the fast bilateral solver (FBS) technique. Specifically, weemploy the geodesic distance component to build the unary term. To ensure bothcomputation efficiency and effective responsiveness for interactivesegmentation, superpixels are used in computing geodesic distances instead ofpixels. Furthermore, we take a bilateral affinity approach for the pairwiseterm in order to preserve edge information and denoise. Through the alternatingdirection strategy, the MRF energy minimization problem is divided into twosubproblems, which then can be easily solved by steepest gradient descent (SGD)and FBS respectively.

Three main challenges existincluding spatial (image) feature representation, temporal informationrepresentation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown byCarreira and Zisserman that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrainedon ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial and temporal representationlearning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs are much moreexpensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speedand accuracy by building an effective and efficient video classification systemthrough systematic exploration of critical network design choices. Inparticular, we show that it is possible to replace many of the 3D convolutionsby low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speedand accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom ofthe network, suggesting that temporal representation learning on high-levelsemantic features is more useful. Our conclusion generalizes to datasets withvery different properties. When combined with several other cost-effectivedesigns including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating,our system results in an effective video classification system that thatproduces very competitive results on several action classification benchmarks(Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well as two actiondetection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).", "authors": ["Saining Xie", "Chen Sun", "Jonathan Huang", "Zhuowen Tu", "Kevin Murphy"], "categories": ["cs.CV"]}

Our model incorporates joint learning ofmeaningful photographic attributes and image content information which can helpregularize the complicated photo aesthetics rating problem.  To train and analyze this model, we have assembled a new aesthetics andattributes database (AADB) which contains aesthetic scores and meaningfulattributes assigned to each image by multiple human raters.

Old rarely utilized knowledge can beoverwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently usedknowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems,lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge overtasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that,given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to belearned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired byneuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coinedMemory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of aneural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample whichis fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameterof the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to achange in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to importantparameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledgerelated to previous tasks from being overwritten.

This coretrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a correspondingdecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architectureof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutionallayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the lowresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps forpixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in whichthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of thecorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates theneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are thenconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps.

However, DVO heavily relies on high-quality imagesand accurate initial pose estimation during tracking, which means that DVO mayfail if the image quality is poor or the initial value is incorrect. With theoutstanding performance of deep learning, like image analysis and processing,previous works have shown that deep neural networks can effectively learn the6-DOF pose between frames from large volumes of image sequences in anunsupervised manner. However, these unsupervised deep learning-based frameworkscannot accurately generate the full trajectory of a long monocular videobecause of the scale-inconsistency between each pose. To tackle this problem,we take several measures to improve the scale-consistency of our network(TrajNet), including improving the previous loss function and proposing a novelscale-to-trajectory constraint. Besides, considering the lack of mapping threadin deep learning-based visual odometry (VO), a new architecture, called deepdirect sparse odometry (DDSO), is proposed to overcome the limitations of DVOas well as the mapping of deep learning-based VO by embedding our TrajNet intoDVO.

We describe a flexible learning frameworkbased on the concept of nonlinear reaction diffusion models for various imagerestoration problems. By embodying recent improvements in nonlinear diffusionmodels, we propose a dynamic nonlinear reaction diffusion model withtime-dependent parameters (\\ie, linear filters and influence functions). Incontrast to previous nonlinear diffusion models, all the parameters, includingthe filters and the influence functions, are simultaneously learned fromtraining data through a loss based approach. We call this approach TNRD --\\textit{Trainable Nonlinear Reaction Diffusion}. The TNRD approach isapplicable for a variety of image restoration tasks by incorporatingappropriate reaction force. We demonstrate its capabilities with threerepresentative applications, Gaussian image denoising, single image superresolution and JPEG deblocking. Experiments show that our trained nonlineardiffusion models largely benefit from the training of the parameters andfinally lead to the best reported performance on common test datasets for thetested applications. Our trained models preserve the structural simplicity ofdiffusion models and take only a small number of diffusion steps, thus arehighly efficient. Moreover, they are also well-suited for parallel computationon GPUs, which makes the inference procedure extremely fast.", "authors": ["Yunjin Chen", "Thomas Pock"], "categories": ["cs.CV"]}

In this paper, we propose a simple tocomplex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized tolearn DCNNs for semantic segmentation.

A projection from a low-level feature space to the semanticrepresentation space is learned from the auxiliary dataset and is appliedwithout adaptation to the target dataset. In this paper we identify twoinherent limitations with these approaches. First, due to having disjoint andpotentially unrelated classes, the projection functions learned from theauxiliary dataset/domain are biased when applied directly to the targetdataset/domain. We call this problem the projection domain shift problem andpropose a novel framework, transductive multi-view embedding, to solve it.

To overcome this problem, a novelheterogeneous multi-view hypergraph label propagation method is formulated forzero-shot learning in the transductive embedding space. It effectively exploitsthe complementary information offered by different semantic representations andtakes advantage of the manifold structures of multiple representation spaces ina coherent manner.

Here, we show that forthe most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix $C$ can behierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of theidentity matrix, yielding an $\\mathcal O (n\\log^2 n) $ algorithm for inversion.More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of thedeterminant $\\det(C)$, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities inhigh dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining $K$. Ourfast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation ofhyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combinationof nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performancecomputing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractableproblems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariancekernels.", "authors": ["Sivaram Ambikasaran", "Daniel Foreman-Mackey", "Leslie Greengard", "David W.

This paper proposes a novel unified framework that jointlyexploits the feature relationships and the class relationships for improvedcategorization performance. Specifically, these two types of relationships areestimated and utilized by rigorously imposing regularizations in the learningprocess of a deep neural network (DNN). Such a regularized DNN (rDNN) can beefficiently realized using a GPU-based implementation with an affordabletraining cost. Through arming the DNN with better capability of harnessing boththe feature and the class relationships, the proposed rDNN is more suitable formodeling video semantics.

Domain Adaptation has therefore emerged asa solution to this problem; It leverages annotated data from a source domain,in which it is abundant, to train a classifier to operate in a target domain,in which it is either sparse or even lacking altogether. In this context, therecent trend consists of learning deep architectures whose weights are sharedfor both domains, which essentially amounts to learning domain invariantfeatures.  Here, we show that it is more effective to explicitly model the shift fromone domain to the other. To this end, we introduce a two-stream architecture,where one operates in the source domain and the other in the target domain.

In this work, we propose a Proposal-Free Network (PFN ) toaddress the instance-level object segmentation problem, which outputs theinstance numbers of different categories and the pixel-level information on 1)the coordinates of the instance bounding box each pixel belongs to, and 2) theconfidences of different categories for each pixel, based on pixel-to-pixeldeep convolutional neural network. All the outputs together, by using anyoff-the-shelf clustering method for simple post-processing, can naturallygenerate the ultimate instance-level object segmentation results. The whole PFNcan be easily trained in an end-to-end way without the requirement of aproposal generation stage. Extensive evaluations on the challenging PASCAL VOC2012 semantic segmentation benchmark demonstrate that the proposed PFN solutionwell beats the state-of-the-arts for instance-level object segmentation. Inparticular, the $AP^r$ over 20 classes at 0.5 IoU reaches 58.7% by PFN,significantly higher than 43.8% and 46.3% by the state-of-the-art algorithms,SDS [9] and [16], respectively.", "authors": ["Xiaodan Liang", "Yunchao Wei", "Xiaohui Shen", "Jianchao Yang", "Liang Lin", "Shuicheng Yan"], "categories": ["cs.CV"]}

Chinese characters are among the most widely adoptedwriting systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused onrecognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only oneaspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting taskis to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters.In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network(RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and agenerative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognizeChinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwritingtrajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach isan end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure anddoes not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combiningan LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on theICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, aconditional generative model with character embedding is proposed forautomatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters(in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by thediscriminative RNN model with high accuracy.

Based on the pictorial structure of Kinect's skeletaldata, an effective tree-structure based traversal framework is also proposed.In order to deal with the noise in the skeletal data, a new gating mechanismwithin LSTM module is introduced, with which the network can learn thereliability of the sequential data and accordingly adjust the effect of theinput data on the updating procedure of the long-term context representationstored in the unit's memory cell. Moreover, we introduce a novel multi-modalfeature fusion strategy within the LSTM unit in this paper. The comprehensiveexperimental results on seven challenging benchmark datasets for human actionrecognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "authors": ["Jun Liu", "Amir Shahroudy", "Dong Xu", "Alex C.

The inherentlysequential structure and data-dependent complexity and latency of iterativeoptimization constitute a major limitation in many applications requiringreal-time performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitationencountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their inclusionin discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose to move theemphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and develop a process-centricview of parsimonious modeling, in which a learned deterministicfixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu of iterative optimization. Weshow a principled way to construct learnable pursuit process architectures forstructured sparse and robust low rank models, derived from the iteration ofproximal descent algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exactparsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the standardoptimization methods. We also show that appropriate training regimes allow tonaturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative settings.State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on several challenging problems inimage and audio processing with several orders of magnitude speedup compared tothe exact optimization algorithms.", "authors": ["Pablo Sprechmann", "Alex M.

While a number of methods havebeen proposed for face attribute estimation, most of them did not explicitlyconsider the attribute correlation and heterogeneity (e.g., ordinal vs. nominaland holistic vs. local) during feature representation learning. In this paper,we present a Deep Multi-Task Learning (DMTL) approach to jointly estimatemultiple heterogeneous attributes from a single face image. In DMTL, we tackleattribute correlation and heterogeneity with convolutional neural networks(CNNs) consisting of shared feature learning for all the attributes, andcategory-specific feature learning for heterogeneous attributes. We alsointroduce an unconstrained face database (LFW+), an extension of public-domainLFW, with heterogeneous demographic attributes (age, gender, and race) obtainedvia crowdsourcing. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple faceattributes (MORPH II, LFW+, CelebA, LFWA, and FotW) show that the proposedapproach has superior performance compared to state of the art. Finally,evaluations on a public-domain face database (LAP) with a single attribute showthat the proposed approach has excellent generalization ability.", "authors": ["Hu Han", "Anil K.

Heterogeneous data sets can be collectively minedby data fusion. Fusion can focus on a specific target relation and exploitdirectly associated data together with contextual data and data about system'sconstraints. In the paper we describe a data fusion approach with penalizedmatrix tri-factorization (DFMF) that simultaneously factorizes data matrices toreveal hidden associations. The approach can directly consider any data thatcan be expressed in a matrix, including those from feature-basedrepresentations, ontologies, associations and networks. We demonstrate theutility of DFMF for gene function prediction task with eleven different datasources and for prediction of pharmacologic actions by fusing six data sources.Our data fusion algorithm compares favorably to alternative data integrationapproaches and achieves higher accuracy than can be obtained from any singledata source alone.", "authors": ["Marinka \u017ditnik", "Bla\u017e Zupan"], "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.DB", "stat.ML", "15A83, 15A23, 40C05, 65F30", "H.2.8; G.1.3; I.2.6; H.3.3"]}

However, such valuable information is often hidden whencomputing similarities of pedestrian images with existing approaches. Inspiredby our user study result of human perception on human saliency, we propose anovel perspective for person re-identification based on learning human saliencyand matching saliency distribution. The proposed saliency learning and matchingframework consists of four steps: (1) To handle misalignment caused by drasticviewpoint change and pose variations, we apply adjacency constrained patchmatching to build dense correspondence between image pairs. (2) We propose twoalternative methods, i.e. K-Nearest Neighbors and One-class SVM, to estimate asaliency score for each image patch, through which distinctive features standout without using identity labels in the training procedure. (3) saliencymatching is proposed based on patch matching. Matching patches withinconsistent saliency brings penalty, and images of the same identity arerecognized by minimizing the saliency matching cost. (4) Furthermore, saliencymatching is tightly integrated with patch matching in a unified structuralRankSVM learning framework. The effectiveness of our approach is validated onthe VIPeR dataset and the CUHK01 dataset. Our approach outperforms thestate-of-the-art person re-identification methods on both datasets.", "authors": ["Rui Zhao", "Wanli Ouyang", "Xiaogang Wang"], "categories": ["cs.CV"]}

Our method first aims at generating a set of high-quality3D object proposals by exploiting stereo imagery. We formulate the problem asminimizing an energy function that encodes object size priors, placement ofobjects on the ground plane as well as several depth informed features thatreason about free space, point cloud densities and distance to the ground. Wethen exploit a CNN on top of these proposals to perform object detection. Inparticular, we employ a convolutional neural net (CNN) that exploits contextand depth information to jointly regress to 3D bounding box coordinates andobject pose. Our experiments show significant performance gains over existingRGB and RGB-D object proposal methods on the challenging KITTI benchmark. Whencombined with the CNN, our approach outperforms all existing results in objectdetection and orientation estimation tasks for all three KITTI object classes.Furthermore, we experiment also with the setting where LIDAR information isavailable, and show that using both LIDAR and stereo leads to the best result.", "authors": ["Xiaozhi Chen", "Kaustav Kundu", "Yukun Zhu", "Huimin Ma", "Sanja Fidler", "Raquel Urtasun"], "categories": ["cs.CV"]}
