On the WMT 2014English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yieldsimprovements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations,respectively.

       "  'abstract': 'In neural machine translation (NMT), generation of a target word depends onboth source and target contexts. We find that source contexts have a directimpact on the adequacy of a translation while target contexts affect thefluency. Intuitively, generation of a content word should rely more on thesource context and generation of a functional word should rely more on thetarget context. Due to the lack of effective control over the influence fromsource and target contexts, conventional NMT tends to yield fluent butinadequate translations. To address this problem, we propose context gateswhich dynamically control the ratios at which source and target contextscontribute to the generation of target words. In this way, we can enhance boththe adequacy and fluency of NMT with more careful control of the informationflow from contexts.

Inaddition to improving predictive performance, these are often touted asaffording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distributionover attended-to input units, and this is often presented (at least implicitly)as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear whatrelationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work,we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim toassess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations'for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learnedattention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures offeature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributionsthat nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standardattention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not betreated as though they do.

Several recent works tackle thisproblem, and propose methods for significantly reducing this gender bias inword embeddings, demonstrating convincing results. However, we argue that thisremoval is superficial. While the bias is indeed substantially reducedaccording to the provided bias definition, the actual effect is mostly hidingthe bias, not removing it. The gender bias information is still reflected inthe distances between \"gender-neutralized\" words in the debiased embeddings,and can be recovered from them. We present a series of experiments to supportthis claim, for two debiasing methods.

       "  'abstract': 'Large-scale datasets for natural language inference are created by presentingcrowd workers with a sentence (premise), and asking them to generate three newsentences (hypotheses) that it entails, contradicts, or is logically neutralwith respect to. We show that, in a significant portion of such data, thisprotocol leaves clues that make it possible to identify the label by lookingonly at the hypothesis, without observing the premise. Specifically, we showthat a simple text categorization model can correctly classify the hypothesisalone in about 67% of SNLI (Bowman et. al, 2015) and 53% of MultiNLI (Williamset. al, 2017). Our analysis reveals that specific linguistic phenomena such asnegation and vagueness are highly correlated with certain inference classes.Our findings suggest that the success of natural language inference models todate has been overestimated, and that the task remains a hard open problem.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'While end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkableprogress recently, NMT systems only rely on parallel corpora for parameterestimation. Since parallel corpora are usually limited in quantity, quality,and coverage, especially for low-resource languages, it is appealing to exploitmonolingual corpora to improve NMT. We propose a semi-supervised approach fortraining NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) andunlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct themonolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the source-to-target andtarget-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder,respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of thetarget language, but also of the source language.

We also propose a novel method ofencoding partial lexicon matches in neural networks and compare it to existingapproaches.

The construction of BERT makes itunsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised taskslike clustering.

Research inautomating this task has been conducted in a variety of disciplines includingnatural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation,databases, and journalism. While there has been substantial progress, relevantpapers and articles have been published in research communities that are oftenunaware of each other and use inconsistent terminology, thus impedingunderstanding and further progress. In this paper we survey automated factchecking research stemming from natural language processing and relateddisciplines, unifying the task formulations and methodologies across papers andauthors. Furthermore, we highlight the use of evidence as an importantdistinguishing factor among them cutting across task formulations and methods.We conclude with proposing avenues for future NLP research on automated factchecking.',\n",

Recent work on readingcomprehension made headway in answering simple questions, but tackling complexquestions is still an ongoing research challenge. Conversely, semantic parsershave been successful at handling compositionality, but only when theinformation resides in a target knowledge-base. In this paper, we present anovel framework for answering broad and complex questions, assuming answeringsimple questions is possible using a search engine and a reading comprehensionmodel. We propose to decompose complex questions into a sequence of simplequestions, and compute the final answer from the sequence of answers. Toillustrate the viability of our approach, we create a new dataset of complexquestions, ComplexWebQuestions, and present a model that decomposes questionsand interacts with the web to compute an answer. We empirically demonstratethat question decomposition improves performance from 20.8 precision@1 to 27.5precision@1 on this new dataset.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Today when many practitioners run basic NLP on the entire web andlarge-volume traffic, faster methods are paramount to saving time and energycosts. Recent advances in GPU hardware have led to the emergence ofbi-directional LSTMs as a standard method for obtaining per-token vectorrepresentations serving as input to labeling tasks such as NER (often followedby prediction in a linear-chain CRF). Though expressive and accurate, thesemodels fail to fully exploit GPU parallelism, limiting their computationalefficiency. This paper proposes a faster alternative to Bi-LSTMs for NER:Iterated Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (ID-CNNs), which have bettercapacity than traditional CNNs for large context and structured prediction.Unlike LSTMs whose sequential processing on sentences of length N requires O(N)time even in the face of parallelism, ID-CNNs permit fixed-depth convolutionsto run in parallel across entire documents. We describe a distinct combinationof network structure, parameter sharing and training procedures that enabledramatic 14-20x test-time speedups while retaining accuracy comparable to theBi-LSTM-CRF. Moreover, ID-CNNs trained to aggregate context from the entiredocument are even more accurate while maintaining 8x faster test time speeds.',\n",

These tasks have focused on literal descriptions of theimage. To move beyond the literal, we choose to explore how questions about animage are often directed at commonsense inference and the abstract eventsevoked by objects in the image. In this paper, we introduce the novel task ofVisual Question Generation (VQG), where the system is tasked with asking anatural and engaging question when shown an image. We provide three datasetswhich cover a variety of images from object-centric to event-centric, withconsiderably more abstract training data than provided to state-of-the-artcaptioning systems thus far. We train and test several generative and retrievalmodels to tackle the task of VQG. Evaluation results show that while suchmodels ask reasonable questions for a variety of images, there is still a widegap with human performance which motivates further work on connecting imageswith commonsense knowledge and pragmatics. Our proposed task offers a newchallenge to the community which we hope furthers interest in exploring deeperconnections between vision &amp; language.',\n",

We observe that whether or not an algorithm uses a particular featureset (sentence IDs) accounts for a significant performance gap among thesealgorithms. This feature set is also used by traditional alignment algorithms,such as IBM Model-1, which demonstrate similar performance to state-of-the-artembedding algorithms on a variety of benchmarks. Overall, we observe thatdifferent algorithmic approaches for utilizing the sentence ID feature spaceresult in similar performance. This paper draws both empirical and theoreticalparallels between the embedding and alignment literature, and suggests thatadding additional sources of information, which go beyond the traditionalsignal of bilingual sentence-aligned corpora, may substantially improvecross-lingual word embeddings, and that future baselines should at least takesuch features into account.',\n",

We demonstrate the efficacy ofweight pruning as a compression technique for a state-of-the-art NMT system.

The outputs from the discriminator are then used as rewards for thegenerative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemblehuman dialogues.  In addition to adversarial training we describe a model for adversarial {\\\\emevaluation} that uses success in fooling an adversary as a dialogue evaluationmetric, while avoiding a number of potential pitfalls.

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper, we propose a novel embedding model, named ConvKB, forknowledge base completion. Our model ConvKB advances state-of-the-art models byemploying a convolutional neural network, so that it can capture globalrelationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relationsin knowledge bases. In ConvKB, each triple (head entity, relation, tail entity)is represented as a 3-column matrix where each column vector represents atriple element. This 3-column matrix is then fed to a convolution layer wheremultiple filters are operated on the matrix to generate different feature maps.These feature maps are then concatenated into a single feature vectorrepresenting the input triple. The feature vector is multiplied with a weightvector via a dot product to return a score. This score is then used to predictwhether the triple is valid or not. Experiments show that ConvKB achievesbetter link prediction performance than previous state-of-the-art embeddingmodels on two benchmark datasets WN18RR and FB15k-237.',\n",

In this paper we benchmark {\\\\bf recursive} neural modelsagainst sequential {\\\\bf recurrent} neural models (simple recurrent and LSTMmodels), enforcing apples-to-apples comparison as much as possible. Weinvestigate 4 tasks: (1) sentiment classification at the sentence level andphrase level; (2) matching questions to answer-phrases; (3) discourse parsing;(4) semantic relation extraction (e.g., {\\\\em component-whole} between nouns).  Our goal is to understand better when, and why, recursive models canoutperform simpler models. We find that recursive models help mainly on tasks(like semantic relation extraction) that require associating headwords across along distance, particularly on very long sequences. We then introduce a methodfor allowing recurrent models to achieve similar performance: breaking longsentences into clause-like units at punctuation and processing them separatelybefore combining. Our results thus help understand the limitations of bothclasses of models, and suggest directions for improving recurrent models.',\n",

SMN first matchesa response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels ofgranularity, and distills important matching information from each pair as avector with convolution and pooling operations. The vectors are thenaccumulated in a chronological order through a recurrent neural network (RNN)which models relationships among utterances.

While most sentences are more accurate and fluent thantranslations by statistical machine translation (SMT)-based systems, in somecases, the NMT system produces translations that have a completely differentmeaning. This is especially the case when rare words occur.  When using statistical machine translation, it has already been shown thatsignificant gains can be achieved by simplifying the input in a preprocessingstep. A commonly used example is the pre-reordering approach.  In this work, we used phrase-based machine translation to pre-translate theinput into the target language. Then a neural machine translation systemgenerates the final hypothesis using the pre-translation. Thereby, we useeither only the output of the phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) system ora combination of the PBMT output and the source sentence.  We evaluate the technique on the English to German translation task. Usingthis approach we are able to outperform the PBMT system as well as the baselineneural MT system by up to 2 BLEU points.

Our results suggest that while intrinsictasks tend to exhibit a clear preference to particular types of contexts andhigher dimensionality, more careful tuning is required for finding the optimalsettings for most of the extrinsic tasks that we considered. Furthermore, forthese extrinsic tasks, we find that once the benefit from increasing theembedding dimensionality is mostly exhausted, simple concatenation of wordembeddings, learned with different context types, can yield further performancegains.

       "  'abstract': 'Current state-of-the-art semantic role labeling (SRL) uses a deep neuralnetwork with no explicit linguistic features. However, prior work has shownthat gold syntax trees can dramatically improve SRL decoding, suggesting thepossibility of increased accuracy from explicit modeling of syntax. In thiswork, we present linguistically-informed self-attention (LISA): a neuralnetwork model that combines multi-head self-attention with multi-task learningacross dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, predicate detection and SRL.Unlike previous models which require significant pre-processing to preparelinguistic features, LISA can incorporate syntax using merely raw tokens asinput, encoding the sequence only once to simultaneously perform parsing,predicate detection and role labeling for all predicates. Syntax isincorporated by training one attention head to attend to syntactic parents foreach token. Moreover, if a high-quality syntactic parse is already available,it can be beneficially injected at test time without re-training our SRL model.In experiments on CoNLL-2005 SRL, LISA achieves new state-of-the-artperformance for a model using predicted predicates and standard wordembeddings, attaining 2.5 F1 absolute higher than the previous state-of-the-arton newswire and more than 3.5 F1 on out-of-domain data, nearly 10% reduction inerror. On ConLL-2012 English SRL we also show an improvement of more than 2.5F1. LISA also out-performs the state-of-the-art with contextually-encoded(ELMo) word representations, by nearly 1.0 F1 on news and more than 2.0 F1 onout-of-domain text.',\n",

Automatic evaluationresults show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-artrule-based system. In human evaluations, questions generated by our system arealso rated as being more natural (i.e., grammaticality, fluency) and as moredifficult to answer (in terms of syntactic and lexical divergence from theoriginal text and reasoning needed to answer).',\n",

The rest of the model, which includes encoder, decoder andattention, remains unchanged and is shared across all languages. Using a sharedwordpiece vocabulary, our approach enables Multilingual NMT using a singlemodel without any increase in parameters, which is significantly simpler thanprevious proposals for Multilingual NMT. Our method often improves thetranslation quality of all involved language pairs, even while keeping thetotal number of model parameters constant.

Similarly, a single multilingual model surpassesstate-of-the-art results for French$\\\\rightarrow$English andGerman$\\\\rightarrow$English on WMT'14 and WMT'15 benchmarks respectively. Onproduction corpora, multilingual models of up to twelve language pairs allowfor better translation of many individual pairs. In addition to improving thetranslation quality of language pairs that the model was trained with, ourmodels can also learn to perform implicit bridging between language pairs neverseen explicitly during training, showing that transfer learning and zero-shottranslation is possible for neural translation. Finally, we show analyses thathints at a universal interlingua representation in our models and show someinteresting examples when mixing languages.\",\n",

Ourneural architecture leverages the shortest dependency path (SDP) between twoentities; multichannel recurrent neural networks, with long short term memory(LSTM) units, pick up heterogeneous information along the SDP. Our proposedmodel has several distinct features: (1) The shortest dependency paths retainmost relevant information (to relation classification), while eliminatingirrelevant words in the sentence. (2) The multichannel LSTM networks alloweffective information integration from heterogeneous sources over thedependency paths. (3) A customized dropout strategy regularizes the neuralnetwork to alleviate overfitting.

With the use of a few semantics-preserving constraints, wedemonstrate that HotFlip can be adapted to attack a word-level classifier aswell.',\n",

Todate, there is no in-depth analysis paper to critically discuss FNC-1'sexperimental setup, reproduce the results, and draw conclusions fornext-generation stance classification methods. In this paper, we provide suchan in-depth analysis for the three top-performing systems. We first find thatFNC-1's proposed evaluation metric favors the majority class, which can beeasily classified, and thus overestimates the true discriminative power of themethods. Therefore, we propose a new F1-based metric yielding a changed systemranking. Next, we compare the features and architectures used, which leads to anovel feature-rich stacked LSTM model that performs on par with the bestsystems, but is superior in predicting minority classes. To understand themethods' ability to generalize, we derive a new dataset and perform bothin-domain and cross-domain experiments. Our qualitative and quantitative studyhelps interpreting the original FNC-1 scores and understand which features helpimproving performance and why. Our new dataset and all source code used duringthe reproduction study are publicly available for future research.\",\n",

The challenge with regard tocopying in Seq2Seq is that new machinery is needed to decide when to performthe operation. In this paper, we incorporate copying into neural network-basedSeq2Seq learning and propose a new model called CopyNet with encoder-decoderstructure. CopyNet can nicely integrate the regular way of word generation inthe decoder with the new copying mechanism which can choose sub-sequences inthe input sequence and put them at proper places in the output sequence.

Linguistic regularities are often sensitive tosyntactic structure; can such dependencies be captured by LSTMs, which do nothave explicit structural representations? We begin addressing this questionusing number agreement in English subject-verb dependencies. We probe thearchitecture's grammatical competence both using training objectives with anexplicit grammatical target (number prediction, grammaticality judgments) andusing language models. In the strongly supervised settings, the LSTM achievedvery high overall accuracy (less than 1% errors), but errors increased whensequential and structural information conflicted. The frequency of such errorsrose sharply in the language-modeling setting. We conclude that LSTMs cancapture a non-trivial amount of grammatical structure given targetedsupervision, but stronger architectures may be required to further reduceerrors; furthermore, the language modeling signal is insufficient for capturingsyntax-sensitive dependencies, and should be supplemented with more directsupervision if such dependencies need to be captured.\",\n",

To shed light on thelinguistic knowledge they capture, we study the representations produced byseveral recent pretrained contextualizers (variants of ELMo, the OpenAItransformer language model, and BERT) with a suite of seventeen diverse probingtasks. We find that linear models trained on top of frozen contextualrepresentations are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific models inmany cases, but fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge(e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the transferability ofcontextual word representations, we quantify differences in the transferabilityof individual layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrentneural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance, higher layers of RNNsare more task-specific, while transformer layers do not exhibit the samemonotonic trend. In addition, to better understand what makes contextual wordrepresentations transferable, we compare language model pretraining with elevensupervised pretraining tasks. For any given task, pretraining on a closelyrelated task yields better performance than language model pretraining (whichis better on average) when the pretraining dataset is fixed.

In this paper, weintroduce a robust syntactic parsing-independent tree structured model, NeuralTree Indexers (NTI) that provides a middle ground between the sequential RNNsand the syntactic treebased recursive models. NTI constructs a full n-ary treeby processing the input text with its node function in a bottom-up fashion.Attention mechanism can then be applied to both structure and node function. Weimplemented and evaluated a binarytree model of NTI, showing the model achievedthe state-of-the-art performance on three different NLP tasks: natural languageinference, answer sentence selection, and sentence classification,outperforming state-of-the-art recurrent and recursive neural networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Natural language inference (NLI) is a fundamentally important task in naturallanguage processing that has many applications. The recently released StanfordNatural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus has made it possible to develop andevaluate learning-centered methods such as deep neural networks for naturallanguage inference (NLI). In this paper, we propose a special long short-termmemory (LSTM) architecture for NLI. Our model builds on top of a recentlyproposed neural attention model for NLI but is based on a significantlydifferent idea. Instead of deriving sentence embeddings for the premise and thehypothesis to be used for classification, our solution uses a match-LSTM toperform word-by-word matching of the hypothesis with the premise. This LSTM isable to place more emphasis on important word-level matching results. Inparticular, we observe that this LSTM remembers important mismatches that arecritical for predicting the contradiction or the neutral relationship label. Onthe SNLI corpus, our model achieves an accuracy of 86.1%, outperforming thestate of the art.',\n",

For this purpose, we complied the Offensive LanguageIdentification Dataset (OLID), a new dataset with tweets annotated foroffensive content using a fine-grained three-layer annotation scheme, which wemake publicly available.

This paper presents a novel word-character solution to achieving openvocabulary NMT. We build hybrid systems that translate mostly at the word leveland consult the character components for rare words. Our character-levelrecurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recoverunknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybridapproach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-basedones; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case ofword-based models. On the WMT'15 English to Czech translation task, this hybridapproach offers an addition boost of +2.1-11.4 BLEU points over models thatalready handle unknown words. Our best system achieves a new state-of-the-artresult with 20.7 BLEU score. We demonstrate that our character models cansuccessfully learn to not only generate well-formed words for Czech, ahighly-inflected language with a very complex vocabulary, but also buildcorrect representations for English source words.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Knowledge bases of real-world facts about entities and their relationshipsare useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks.However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to beable to perform link prediction or knowledge base completion, i.e., predictwhether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. Thispaper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a newembedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensionalvector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE isa simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better linkprediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embeddingmodels. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex modelsin the link prediction task.',\n",

In addition to a straightforwardadaptation of CNN from image to text, a simple but new variation which employsbag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer is proposed.

Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluationmetrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of responsequality. Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial fordialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new modelswith fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, weformulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present anevaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to inputresponses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEMmodel's predictions correlate significantly, and at a level much higher thanword-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utteranceand system-level.

A variety of approaches and features were used by the participating systemsto address the different subtasks. The best systems achieved an official score(MAP) of 88.43, 47.22, 15.46, and 61.16 in subtasks A, B, C, and D,respectively.

In fact selection, we match the subject entity in a fact candidatewith the entity mention in the question by a character-level convolutionalneural network (char-CNN), and match the predicate in that fact with thequestion by a word-level CNN (word-CNN).

However, they suffer from two keytechnical problems that make them slow and unwieldy for large-scale NLP tasks:they usually operate on parsed sentences and they do not directly supportbatched computation. We address these issues by introducing the Stack-augmentedParser-Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN), which combines parsing andinterpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integratingtree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure ofa shift-reduce parser. Our model supports batched computation for a speedup ofup to 25 times over other tree-structured models, and its integrated parser canoperate on unparsed data with little loss in accuracy.

In this paper, we propose and implement aneffective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on datathat is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMTsystem to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of itscorresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilizedin a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary.Our experiments on the WMT14 English to French translation task show that thismethod provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over anequivalent NMT system that does not use this technique.

       "  'abstract': \"Opinion mining from customer reviews has become pervasive in recent years.Sentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, eventhough they form part of a review's argumentative structure. Intuitively,sentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of thereview structure and sentential context should thus inform the classificationof each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-basedsentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a reviewwith a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical modeloutperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive withthe state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on fivemultilingual, multi-domain datasets without any hand-engineered features orexternal resources.\",\n",

In this paper, we propose a variational model to learnthis conditional distribution for neural machine translation: a variationalencoderdecoder model that can be trained end-to-end. Different from the vanillaencoder-decoder model that generates target translations from hiddenrepresentations of source sentences alone, the variational model introduces acontinuous latent variable to explicitly model underlying semantics of sourcesentences and to guide the generation of target translations. In order toperform efficient posterior inference and large-scale training, we build aneural posterior approximator conditioned on both the source and the targetsides, and equip it with a reparameterization technique to estimate thevariational lower bound.

Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has itslimitation in handling a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well asdecoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. Inthis paper, we propose a method that allows us to use a very large targetvocabulary without increasing training complexity, based on importancesampling. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the modelhaving a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of thewhole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach areempirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary aswell as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when weuse the ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies, weachieve the state-of-the-art translation performance (measured by BLEU) on theEnglish-&gt;German translation and almost as high performance as state-of-the-artEnglish-&gt;French translation system.',\n",

We introduce HybridCode Networks (HCNs), which combine an RNN with domain-specific knowledgeencoded as software and system action templates. Compared to existingend-to-end approaches, HCNs considerably reduce the amount of training datarequired, while retaining the key benefit of inferring a latent representationof dialog state. In addition, HCNs can be optimized with supervised learning,reinforcement learning, or a mixture of both.

This work presents a generalAttention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair ofsentences. We make three contributions. (i) ABCNN can be applied to a widevariety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs.

We propose an extension of graph convolutionalnetworks that is tailored for relation extraction, which pools information overarbitrary dependency structures efficiently in parallel. To incorporaterelevant information while maximally removing irrelevant content, we furtherapply a novel pruning strategy to the input trees by keeping words immediatelyaround the shortest path between the two entities among which a relation mighthold.

In this paper, we explore a general relation extraction frameworkbased on graph long short-term memory networks (graph LSTMs) that can be easilyextended to cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction. The graph formulationprovides a unified way of exploring different LSTM approaches and incorporatingvarious intra-sentential and inter-sentential dependencies, such as sequential,syntactic, and discourse relations. A robust contextual representation islearned for the entities, which serves as input to the relation classifier.This simplifies handling of relations with arbitrary arity, and enablesmulti-task learning with related relations. We evaluate this framework in twoimportant precision medicine settings, demonstrating its effectiveness withboth conventional supervised learning and distant supervision. Cross-sentenceextraction produced larger knowledge bases. and multi-task learningsignificantly improved extraction accuracy. A thorough analysis of various LSTMapproaches yielded useful insight the impact of linguistic analysis onextraction accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the most popular architectures usedin Natural Language Processsing (NLP) tasks because its recurrent structure isvery suitable to process variable-length text. RNN can utilize distributedrepresentations of words by first converting the tokens comprising each textinto vectors, which form a matrix. And this matrix includes two dimensions: thetime-step dimension and the feature vector dimension. Then most existing modelsusually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-basedoperation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector.However, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutuallyindependent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-stepdimension independently may destroy the structure of the featurerepresentation. On the other hand, applying two-dimensional (2D) poolingoperation over the two dimensions may sample more meaningful features forsequence modeling tasks. To integrate the features on both dimensions of thematrix, this paper explores applying 2D max pooling operation to obtain afixed-length representation of the text. This paper also utilizes 2Dconvolution to sample more meaningful information of the matrix. Experimentsare conducted on six text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis,question classification, subjectivity classification and newsgroupclassification. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed modelsachieve excellent performance on 4 out of 6 tasks.

As a result these models are costly to train and develop, bothfinancially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time,and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensorprocessing hardware.

We demonstrate thatstandard knowledge distillation applied to word-level prediction can beeffective for NMT, and also introduce two novel sequence-level versions ofknowledge distillation that further improve performance, and somewhatsurprisingly, seem to eliminate the need for beam search (even when applied onthe original teacher model). Our best student model runs 10 times faster thanits state-of-the-art teacher with little loss in performance. It is alsosignificantly better than a baseline model trained without knowledgedistillation: by 4.2/1.7 BLEU with greedy decoding/beam search.

       "  'abstract': \"The past year has witnessed rapid advances in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)modeling for Machine Translation (MT). The classic RNN-based approaches to MTwere first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model, which was thenout-performed by the more recent Transformer model. Each of these newapproaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set ofmodeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to otherseq2seq architectures. In this paper, we tease apart the new architectures andtheir accompanying techniques in two ways. First, we identify several keymodeling and training techniques, and apply them to the RNN architecture,yielding a new RNMT+ model that outperforms all of the three fundamentalarchitectures on the benchmark WMT'14 English to French and English to Germantasks. Second, we analyze the properties of each fundamental seq2seqarchitecture and devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine theirstrengths. Our hybrid models obtain further improvements, outperforming theRNMT+ model on both benchmark datasets.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Directly reading documents and being able to answer questions from them is anunsolved challenge. To avoid its inherent difficulty, question answering (QA)has been directed towards using Knowledge Bases (KBs) instead, which has proveneffective. Unfortunately KBs often suffer from being too restrictive, as theschema cannot support certain types of answers, and too sparse, e.g. Wikipediacontains much more information than Freebase. In this work we introduce a newmethod, Key-Value Memory Networks, that makes reading documents more viable byutilizing different encodings in the addressing and output stages of the memoryread operation. To compare using KBs, information extraction or Wikipediadocuments directly in a single framework we construct an analysis tool,WikiMovies, a QA dataset that contains raw text alongside a preprocessed KB, inthe domain of movies. Our method reduces the gap between all three settings. Italso achieves state-of-the-art results on the existing WikiQA benchmark.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modeling textual or visual information with vector representations trainedfrom large language or visual datasets has been successfully explored in recentyears. However, tasks such as visual question answering require combining thesevector representations with each other. Approaches to multimodal poolinginclude element-wise product or sum, as well as concatenation of the visual andtextual representations. We hypothesize that these methods are not asexpressive as an outer product of the visual and textual vectors. As the outerproduct is typically infeasible due to its high dimensionality, we insteadpropose utilizing Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to efficiently andexpressively combine multimodal features. We extensively evaluate MCB on thevisual question answering and grounding tasks. We consistently show the benefitof MCB over ablations without MCB. For visual question answering, we present anarchitecture which uses MCB twice, once for predicting attention over spatialfeatures and again to combine the attended representation with the questionrepresentation.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper reports on a writing style analysis of hyperpartisan (i.e.,extremely one-sided) news in connection to fake news. It presents a largecorpus of 1,627 articles that were manually fact-checked by professionaljournalists from BuzzFeed. The articles originated from 9 well-known politicalpublishers, 3 each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left-wing, and thehyperpartisan right-wing. In sum, the corpus contains 299 fake news, 97% ofwhich originated from hyperpartisan publishers.  We propose and demonstrate a new way of assessing style similarity betweentext categories via Unmasking---a meta-learning approach originally devised forauthorship verification---, revealing that the style of left-wing andright-wing news have a lot more in common than any of the two have with themainstream. Furthermore, we show that hyperpartisan news can be discriminatedwell by its style from the mainstream (F1=0.78), as can be satire from both(F1=0.81). Unsurprisingly, style-based fake news detection does not live up toscratch (F1=0.46). Nevertheless, the former results are important to implementpre-screening for fake news detectors.',\n",

In this paper, we a mechanism to limit the spread of fake news which is notbased on content.

We show that having a few thousands users exposed to one givennews item enables to reach a very precise estimation of its reliability.

Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans uselanguage by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words,hierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than theirtraditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either thehierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisyusing soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extractingthe highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a fewsentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents thatare 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is veryimportant, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of adocument to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful formachine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencieswhile modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted NeuralSemantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmentedneural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novelhierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. Thequality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namelylemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improvedvocabulary coverage and generalization.

       "  'abstract': 'Today text classification models have been widely used. However, theseclassifiers are found to be easily fooled by adversarial examples. Fortunately,standard attacking methods generate adversarial texts in a pair-wise way, thatis, an adversarial text can only be created from a real-world text by replacinga few words. In many applications, these texts are limited in numbers,therefore their corresponding adversarial examples are often not diverse enoughand sometimes hard to read, thus can be easily detected by humans and cannotcreate chaos at a large scale. In this paper, we propose an end to end solutionto efficiently generate adversarial texts from scratch using generative models,which are not restricted to perturbing the given texts. We call it unrestrictedadversarial text generation. Specifically, we train a conditional variationalautoencoder (VAE) with an additional adversarial loss to guide the generationof adversarial examples. Moreover, to improve the validity of adversarialtexts, we utilize discrimators and the training framework of generativeadversarial networks (GANs) to make adversarial texts consistent with realdata. Experimental results on sentiment analysis demonstrate the scalabilityand efficiency of our method. It can attack text classification models with ahigher success rate than existing methods, and provide acceptable quality forhumans in the meantime.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Attention mechanisms play a central role in NLP systems, especially withinrecurrent neural network (RNN) models. Recently, there has been increasinginterest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by thesemodules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, andconsequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. Arecent paper claims that `Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace,2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing thatsuch a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing itneeds to take into account all elements of the model, using a rigorousexperimental design. We propose four alternative tests to determinewhen/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weightsbaseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; adiagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and anend-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningfulinterpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even whenreliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on thesimple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulnessof attention mechanisms for explainability.\",\n",

In thispaper, we propose an architecture, Experts Model, inspired from the standardMixture of Experts (MoE) model. The key idea here is each expert learnsdifferent sets of features from the feature vector which helps in betteremotion detection from the tweet. We compared the results of our Experts Modelwith both baseline results and top five performers of SemEval-2018 Task-1,Affect in Tweets (AIT). The experimental results show that our proposedapproach deals with the emotion detection problem and stands at top-5 results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sentiment classification typically relies on a large amount of labeled data.In practice, the availability of labels is highly imbalanced among differentlanguages, e.g., more English texts are labeled than texts in any otherlanguages, which creates a considerable inequality in the quality of relatedinformation services received by users speaking different languages. To tacklethis problem, cross-lingual sentiment classification approaches aim to transferknowledge learned from one language that has abundant labeled examples (i.e.,the source language, usually English) to another language with fewer labels(i.e., the target language). The source and the target languages are usuallybridged through off-the-shelf machine translation tools. Through such achannel, cross-language sentiment patterns can be successfully learned fromEnglish and transferred into the target languages. This approach, however,often fails to capture sentiment knowledge specific to the target language, andthus compromises the accuracy of the downstream classification task. In thispaper, we employ emojis, which are widely available in many languages, as a newchannel to learn both the cross-language and the language-specific sentimentpatterns. We propose a novel representation learning method that uses emojiprediction as an instrument to learn respective sentiment-aware representationsfor each language. The learned representations are then integrated tofacilitate cross-lingual sentiment classification. The proposed methoddemonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, which issustained even when sentiment labels are scarce.',\n",

We first utilize linguistic rules to determinewhich constituents to expand and what types of modifiers to expand with. Wethen expand each constituent by inserting an adversarial modifier searched froma CVAE-based generative model which is pre-trained on a large scale corpus.

Existing methods require acommon target language, language relatedness, or specific training tricks andregimes. We present a simple transfer learning method, where we first train a\"parent\" model for a high-resource language pair and then continue the trainingon a lowresource pair only by replacing the training corpus.

We comparedthe RNNG model that jointly identify entities and their relations with separateBiLSTMs models for entities and relations as baselines. We call seq-BiLSTMs thebaseline models for relations extraction that takes as extra-input the outputof the BiLSTMs for entities. RNNG outperforms seq-BiLSTM for identifyingrelations, with on average 88.5% [87.2-89.8] versus 84.6 [83.1-86.1] F-measure.However, RNNG is weaker than the baseline BiLSTM on detecting entities, with onaverage 82.4 [80.8-83.8] versus 84.1 [82.7-85.6] % F- measure. RNNG trainedonly for detecting relations is weaker than RNNG with the joint modellingobjective, 87.4 [85.8-88.8] versus 88.5% [87.2-89.8]. The performance of RNNGon relations can be explained both by the model architecture, which providesshortcut between distant parts of the sentence, and the joint modellingobjective which allow the RNNG to learn richer representations. RNNG isefficient for modeling relations between entities in medical texts and itsperformances are close to those of a BiLSTM for entity detection.',\n",

A proposedexplanation of the origin of the high-field phase is theFulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. This state is characterized byinhomogeneous superconductivity, where the Cooper pairs have finitecenter-of-mass momenta. Recently, the high-field phase has been observed inFeSe, and it was deemed to originate from the FFLO state. Here, we synthesizedFeSe single crystals with different levels of disorders. The level of disorderis expressed by the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length andranges between 35 and 1.2. The upper critical field $B_{\\\\rm{c}2}$ wassystematically studied over a wide range of temperatures, which went as low as$\\\\sim$ 0.5 K, and magnetic fields, which went up to $\\\\sim$ 38 T along the $c$axis and in the $ab$ plane. In the high-field region parallel to the $ab$plane, an unusual SC phase was confirmed in all the crystals, and the phase wasfound to be robust to disorders. This result suggests that the high-filed SCstate in FeSe may not be a FFLO state, which should be sensitive to disorders.',\n",

Despite numerousattempts during the two last decades, the majority of reinforcement learningalgorithms and associated approximate models, applied to this context, stillassume Markovian state transitions. In this paper, we explore the use of arecently proposed attention-based model, the Gated End-to-End Memory Network,for sequential control. We call the resulting model the Gated End-to-End MemoryPolicy Network. More precisely, we use a model-free value-based algorithm tolearn policies for partially observed domains using this memory-enhanced neuralnetwork. This model is end-to-end learnable and it features unbounded memory.Indeed, because of its attention mechanism and associated non-parametricmemory, the proposed model allows us to define an attention mechanism over theobservation stream unlike recurrent models. We show encouraging results thatillustrate the capability of our attention-based model in the context of thecontinuous-state non-stationary control problem of stock trading.

Our main finding is thatincorporating the two synergistic modalities, in a combined model, improvesaccuracy in an emoji prediction task.

Meanwhile,researchers also try to answer the question that whether the obtainedinterpretation is faithful in explaining mechanisms behind model prediction?Specifically, (Jain and Wallace, 2019) proposes that \"attention is notexplanation\" by comparing attention interpretation with gradient alternatives.However, it raises a new question that can we safely pick one interpretationmethod as the ground-truth? If not, on what basis can we compare differentinterpretation methods? In this work, we propose that it is crucial to have aconcrete definition of interpretation before we could evaluate faithfulness ofan interpretation. The definition will affect both the algorithm to obtaininterpretation and, more importantly, the metric used in evaluation. Throughboth theoretical and experimental analysis, we find that althoughinterpretation methods perform differently under a certain evaluation metric,such a difference may not result from interpretation quality or faithfulness,but rather the inherent bias of the evaluation metric.',\n",

Emojis also carry signals that can be used to betterunderstand communicative intent. They have become a ubiquitous part of ourdaily lives, making them an important part of understanding user-generatedcontent.

Through emoji prediction, models can learnrich representations of the communicative intent of the written text. Whileexisting research on the emoji prediction task focus on a small subset of emojitypes closely related to certain emotions, this setting oversimplifies the taskand wastes the expressive power of emojis.

Using controlled experimentalmethods from psycholinguistics, we compare the performance of word-based LSTMmodels versus two models that represent hierarchical structure and deploy it inleft-to-right processing: Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (RNNGs) (Dyer etal., 2016) and a incrementalized version of the Parsing-as-Language-Modelingconfiguration from Chariak et al., (2016). Models are tested on a diverse rangeof configurations for two classes of non-local grammatical dependencies inEnglish---Negative Polarity licensing and Filler--Gap Dependencies. Using thesame training data across models, we find that structurally-supervised modelsoutperform the LSTM, with the RNNG demonstrating best results on both types ofgrammatical dependencies and even learning many of the Island Constraints onthe filler--gap dependency.

With a~1 month run, APEX will achieve very good sensitivity because the statistics ofe+e- pairs will be ~10,000 times larger in the explored mass range than anyprevious search for the A\\' boson.

The magnitude of theinduced uniaxial anisotropy grows with the increasing external magnetic field.The filler particles are immobilized in the matrix if the MAE sample is cooledbelow 220 K, where the anisotropy can be read out. The cooling of the sample isconsidered as an alternative methodological approach to the experimentalinvestigation of the magnetized state of MAEs. The appearance of magneticanisotropy in MAE is associated with restructuring of the filler duringmagnetization, which leads to an additional effective field felt by themagnetization. It is found that the magnitude of the effective magneticanisotropy constant of the MAE is approximately two times larger than itseffective shear modulus in the absence of magnetic field. It is proposed thatthe experimentally observed large (about 40) ratio of the magnetic anisotropyconstant of the filler to the shear modulus of the matrix deserves attentionfor the explanation of magnetic and magnetoelastic properties of MAEs. It maylead to additional rigidity of the elastic subsystem increasing the shearmodulus of the composite material through the magnetomechanical coupling.',\n",

We demonstratethe effectiveness of our model in three machine translation scenarios:in-domain training, mixed-domain training, and learning from a mix ofgold-standard and synthetic data. Our experiments show consistently that ourjoint formulation outperforms conditional modelling (i.e. standard neuralmachine translation) in all such scenarios.',\n",

Recently this phenomenon has attracted lot of public attention,because it is causing significant social and financial impacts on their livesand businesses. Fake news are responsible for creating false, deceptive,misleading, and suspicious information that can greatly effect the outcome ofan event. This paper presents a synopsis that explains what are fake news withexamples and also discusses some of the current machine learning techniques,specifically natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning, forautomatically predicting and detecting fake news.

While various explainable AI (XAI) approaches aimat mitigating the lack of transparency in deep networks, the evidence of theeffectiveness of these approaches in improving usability, trust, andunderstanding of AI systems are still missing. We evaluate multimodalexplanations in the setting of a Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, byasking users to predict the response accuracy of a VQA agent with and withoutexplanations. We use between-subjects and within-subjects experiments to probeexplanation effectiveness in terms of improving user prediction accuracy,confidence, and reliance, among other factors. The results indicate that theexplanations help improve human prediction accuracy, especially in trials whenthe VQA system's answer is inaccurate. Furthermore, we introduce activeattention, a novel method for evaluating causal attentional effects throughintervention by editing attention maps. User explanation ratings are stronglycorrelated with human prediction accuracy and suggest the efficacy of theseexplanations in human-machine AI collaboration tasks.\",\n",
