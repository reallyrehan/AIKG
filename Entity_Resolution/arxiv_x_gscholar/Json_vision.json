Although the latest RegionProposal Network method gets promising detection accuracy with several hundredproposals, it still struggles in small-size object detection and preciselocalization (e.g., large IoU thresholds), mainly due to the coarseness of itsfeature maps. In this paper, we present a deep hierarchical network, namelyHyperNet, for handling region proposal generation and object detection jointly.Our HyperNet is primarily based on an elaborately designed Hyper Feature whichaggregates hierarchical feature maps first and then compresses them into auniform space. The Hyper Features well incorporate deep but highly semantic,intermediate but really complementary, and shallow but naturallyhigh-resolution features of the image, thus enabling us to construct HyperNetby sharing them both in generating proposals and detecting objects via anend-to-end joint training strategy.

As a result, they fail to generate diverse outputs from a given sourcedomain image. To address this limitation, we propose a Multimodal UnsupervisedImage-to-image Translation (MUNIT) framework. We assume that the imagerepresentation can be decomposed into a content code that is domain-invariant,and a style code that captures domain-specific properties. To translate animage to another domain, we recombine its content code with a random style codesampled from the style space of the target domain. We analyze the proposedframework and establish several theoretical results. Extensive experiments withcomparisons to the state-of-the-art approaches further demonstrates theadvantage of the proposed framework. Moreover, our framework allows users tocontrol the style of translation outputs by providing an example style image.Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/nvlabs/MUNIT", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "journal": "Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 172-189", "citations": "553", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04732v2", "gscholar_url": "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=13317525907573308290&btnI=1&nossl=1&hl=en&oe=ASCII"}, "69": {"ID": 69, "title": "A Point Set Generation Network for 3D Object Reconstruction from a  Single Image", "authors": ["Hao Su", "Leonidas Guibas", "Haoqiang Fan"], "published": "2016-12-02T09:20:09Z", "updated": "2016-12-07T01:12:53Z", "abstract": "Generation of 3D data by deep neural network has been attracting increasingattention in the research community.

We examine the architectures of various 3DCNNs from relatively shallow to very deep ones on current video datasets. Basedon the results of those experiments, the following conclusions could beobtained: (i) ResNet-18 training resulted in significant overfitting forUCF-101, HMDB-51, and ActivityNet but not for Kinetics. (ii) The Kineticsdataset has sufficient data for training of deep 3D CNNs, and enables trainingof up to 152 ResNets layers, interestingly similar to 2D ResNets on ImageNet.ResNeXt-101 achieved 78.4% average accuracy on the Kinetics test set. (iii)Kinetics pretrained simple 3D architectures outperforms complex 2Darchitectures, and the pretrained ResNeXt-101 achieved 94.5% and 70.2% onUCF-101 and HMDB-51, respectively.

Two mainfactors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due toexponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatchbetween the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the inputhypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, isproposed to address these problems.

Our hypothesis isthat if a gallery image is similar to the probe in the k-reciprocal nearestneighbors, it is more likely to be a true match. Specifically, given an image,a k-reciprocal feature is calculated by encoding its k-reciprocal nearestneighbors into a single vector, which is used for re-ranking under the Jaccarddistance. The final distance is computed as the combination of the originaldistance and the Jaccard distance. Our re-ranking method does not require anyhuman interaction or any labeled data, so it is applicable to large-scaledatasets.

However, they are still rarelydeployed on battery-powered mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearablegadgets, where vision algorithms can enable many revolutionary real-worldapplications. The key limiting factor is the high energy consumption of CNNprocessing due to its high computational complexity. While there are manyprevious efforts that try to reduce the CNN model size or amount ofcomputation, we find that they do not necessarily result in lower energyconsumption, and therefore do not serve as a good metric for energy costestimation.  To close the gap between CNN design and energy consumption optimization, wepropose an energy-aware pruning algorithm for CNNs that directly uses energyconsumption estimation of a CNN to guide the pruning process. The energyestimation methodology uses parameters extrapolated from actual hardwaremeasurements that target realistic battery-powered system setups. The proposedlayer-by-layer pruning algorithm also prunes more aggressively than previouslyproposed pruning methods by minimizing the error in output feature maps insteadof filter weights. For each layer, the weights are first pruned and thenlocally fine-tuned with a closed-form least-square solution to quickly restorethe accuracy. After all layers are pruned, the entire network is furtherglobally fine-tuned using back-propagation.

A projection from a low-level feature space to the semanticrepresentation space is learned from the auxiliary dataset and is appliedwithout adaptation to the target dataset. In this paper we identify twoinherent limitations with these approaches. First, due to having disjoint andpotentially unrelated classes, the projection functions learned from theauxiliary dataset/domain are biased when applied directly to the targetdataset/domain. We call this problem the projection domain shift problem andpropose a novel framework, transductive multi-view embedding, to solve it. Thesecond limitation is the prototype sparsity problem which refers to the factthat for each target class, only a single prototype is available for zero-shotlearning given a semantic representation.

For the former, according to the codebooksize, we organize the literature into using large/medium-sized/small codebooks.For the latter, we discuss three lines of methods, i.e., using pre-trained orfine-tuned CNN models, and hybrid methods. The first two perform a single-passof an image to the network, while the last category employs a patch-basedfeature extraction scheme. This survey presents milestones in modern instanceretrieval, reviews a broad selection of previous works in different categories,and provides insights on the connection between SIFT and CNN-based methods.After analyzing and comparing retrieval performance of different categories onseveral datasets, we discuss promising directions towards generic andspecialized instance retrieval.", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 40 (5), 1224-1244", "citations": "348", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01807v2", "gscholar_url": "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=16393680164066993823&btnI=1&nossl=1&hl=en&oe=ASCII"}, "426": {"ID": 426, "title": "Visual Relationship Detection with Language Priors", "authors": ["Li Fei-Fei", "Michael Bernstein", "Ranjay Krishna", "Cewu Lu"], "published": "2016-07-31T05:54:13Z", "updated": "2016-07-31T05:54:13Z", "abstract": "Visual relationships capture a wide variety of interactions between pairs ofobjects in images (e.g. \"man riding bicycle\" and \"man pushing bicycle\").Consequently, the set of possible relationships is extremely large and it isdifficult to obtain sufficient training examples for all possiblerelationships.

Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNNframework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semanticlabel dependency as well as the image-label relevance, and it can be trainedend-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in a unified framework.Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposedarchitecture achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-labelclassification model", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "journal": "Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern\u00a0\u2026", "citations": "536", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04573v1", "gscholar_url": "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=11947203399516238933&btnI=1&nossl=1&hl=en&oe=ASCII"}, "458": {"ID": 458, "title": "MoFA: Model-based Deep Convolutional Face Autoencoder for Unsupervised  Monocular Reconstruction", "authors": ["Florian Bernard", "Michael Zollh\u00f6fer", "Pablo Garrido", "Hyeongwoo Kim", "Christian Theobalt", "Ayush Tewari", "Patrick P\u00e9rez"], "published": "2017-03-30T17:29:42Z", "updated": "2017-12-07T20:38:13Z", "abstract": "In this work we propose a novel model-based deep convolutional autoencoderthat addresses the highly challenging problem of reconstructing a 3D human facefrom a single in-the-wild color image.

The performance gain in most of the existing works is mainlycontributed to the increase of computation burden, especially the floatingnumber operations (FLOPs). In addition, the multi-scale information within eachlayer in FPN has not been well investigated. To this end, we first introduce aninception FPN in which each layer contains convolution filters with differentkernel sizes to enlarge the receptive field and integrate more usefulinformation. Moreover, we point out that not all objects need such acomplicated calculation module and propose a new dynamic FPN (DyFPN). Eachlayer in the DyFPN consists of multiple branches with different computationalcosts. Specifically, the output features of DyFPN will be calculated by usingthe adaptively selected branch according to a learnable gating operation.Therefore, the proposed method can provide a more efficient dynamic inferencefor achieving a better trade-off between accuracy and detection performance.Extensive experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposedDyFPN significantly improves performance with the optimal allocation ofcomputation resources. For instance, replacing the FPN with the inception FPNimproves detection accuracy by 1.6 AP using the Faster R-CNN paradigm on COCOminival, and the DyFPN further reduces about 40% of its FLOPs while maintainingsimilar performance.", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00779v1"}, "725": {"ID": 725, "title": "Fast-UAP: An Algorithm for Speeding up Universal Adversarial  Perturbation Generation with Orientation of Perturbation Vectors", "authors": ["Le Shu", "Jiazhu Dai"], "published": "2019-11-04T12:57:17Z", "updated": "2020-01-06T10:28:26Z", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become one of the most popularmachine learning tools and are being applied in various tasks, however, CNNmodels are vulnerable to universal perturbations, which are usuallyhuman-imperceptible but can cause natural images to be misclassified with highprobability.

Batch-Instance Normalization (BIN) is one of the first proposedmethods that combines two different normalization methods and achieve diversenormalization for different layers. However, two potential issues exist in BIN:first, the Clip function is not differentiable at input values of 0 and 1;second, the combined feature map is not with a normalized distribution which isharmful for signal propagation in DCNN. In this paper, an Instance-LayerNormalization (ILN) layer is proposed by using the Sigmoid function for thefeature map combination, and cascading group normalization. The performance ofILN is validated on image segmentation of the Right Ventricle (RV) and LeftVentricle (LV) using U-Net as the network architecture. The results show thatthe proposed ILN outperforms previous traditional and popular normalizationmethods with noticeable accuracy improvements for most validations, supportingthe effectiveness of the proposed ILN.", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08466v2"}, "766": {"ID": 766, "title": "Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization", "authors": ["Ruimao Zhang", "Zhanglin Peng", "Ping Luo", "Jingyu Li", "Jiamin Ren"], "published": "2018-06-28T05:55:57Z", "updated": "2019-04-24T05:31:23Z", "abstract": "We address a learning-to-normalize problem by proposing SwitchableNormalization (SN), which learns to select different normalizers for differentnormalization layers of a deep neural network.

However, so far, thevulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs arevulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks.

Comparedwith the current regression methods, the proposed Nuclear Norm based MatrixRegression (NMR) model is more robust for alleviating the effect ofillumination, and more intuitive and powerful for removing the structural noisecaused by occlusion.

In contrast, we propose toattend to the instances with dynamic conditional convolutions. Instead of usinginstance-wise ROIs as inputs to the instance mask head of fixed weights, wedesign dynamic instance-aware mask heads, conditioned on the instances to bepredicted. CondInst enjoys three advantages: 1.) Instance and panopticsegmentation are unified into a fully convolutional network, eliminating theneed for ROI cropping and feature alignment. 2.) The elimination of the ROIcropping also significantly improves the output instance mask resolution. 3.)Due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated conditionalconvolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv. layers, eachhaving only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster inference time perinstance and making the overall inference time almost constant, irrelevant tothe number of instances. We demonstrate a simpler method that can achieveimproved accuracy and inference speed on both instance and panopticsegmentation tasks.

The high-resolution image from the low-cost camera canprovide ample information about the surroundings. However, the explicit depthinformation is not available from the image. Inspired by the complementarinessof 3D LiDAR and camera, this paper proposes to make use of the high-resolutionimages from a camera to enrich the raw 3D point clouds from the low-cost 16channels LiDAR based on a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. An ERFNetis firstly employed to segment the image with the aid of the raw sparse 3Dpoint clouds. Meanwhile, the sparse convolutional neural network is employed topredict the dense point clouds based on raw sparse 3D point clouds. Then, thepredicted dense point clouds are fused with the segmentation outputs fromERFnet using a novel multi-layer convolutional neural network to refine thepredicted 3D point clouds. Finally, the enriched point clouds are employed toperform LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art normal distribution transform(NDT). We tested our approach on the re-edited KITTI datasets: (1)the sparse 3Dpoint clouds are significantly enriched with a mean square error of 1.1m MSE.(2)the map generated from the LiDAR SLAM is denser which includes more detailswithout significant accuracy loss.", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.RO"], "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03694v1"}, "1071": {"ID": 1071, "title": "Rethinking Zero-Shot Learning: A Conditional Visual Classification  Perspective", "authors": ["Yun Fu", "Kai Li", "Martin Renqiang Min"], "published": "2019-09-13T01:26:55Z", "updated": "2019-11-27T16:22:41Z", "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize instances of unseen classes solelybased on the semantic descriptions of the classes.

One strongVQA model is the MAC network, which decomposes a task into a series ofattention-based reasoning steps. However, since the MAC network is designed forsingle-turn question answering, it is not capable of referring to past dialogturns.

The threshold used to train adetector defines its \\textit{quality}. While the commonly used threshold of 0.5leads to noisy (low-quality) detections, detection performance frequentlydegrades for larger thresholds. This paradox of high-quality detection has twocauses: 1) overfitting, due to vanishing positive samples for large thresholds,and 2) inference-time quality mismatch between detector and test hypotheses. Amulti-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, composed of asequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, is proposed toaddress these problems. The detectors are trained sequentially, using theoutput of a detector as training set for the next. This resamplingprogressively improves hypotheses quality, guaranteeing a positive training setof equivalent size for all detectors and minimizing overfitting. The samecascade is applied at inference, to eliminate quality mismatches betweenhypotheses and detectors.
