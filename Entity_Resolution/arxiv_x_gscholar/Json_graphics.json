Many photographic styles rely on subtleadjustments that depend on the image content and even its semantics. Further,these adjustments are often spatially varying.

A key enabler of this synthesis route is thatSiC:Ox NW photonic crystal (PC) nanostructures are engineered with tailoredgeometry in precise locations during nanofabrication. These ultrathin NW PCstructures not only facilitate the on-demand positioning of Er3+ ions but arepivotal in engineering the emission properties of these color centers. Througha combinational and systematic micro-PL (uPL) and power-dependence PL (PDPL)spectroscopy, PC architecture geometry effects on Er3+-related 1538 nmemission, which is the telecommunication wavelength used in optical fibers,were studied. Approximately 60-fold and 30-fold enhancements for, respectively,the room-temperature Er3+ PL emission and lifetime in the NW PC sample wereobserved compared to its thin-film analog. Furthermore, the 1538 nm emission inSiC:Ox NW PC was found to be modulated linearly with the PC lattice periodicityof the structure. The observed characteristics reveal the efficientEr3+-emission extraction from the technologically-friendly SiC:Ox NW PCstructures.", "categories": ["cond-mat.mes-hall"], "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05738v2"}, "53": {"ID": 53, "title": "An angular momentum conserving Affine-Particle-In-Cell method", "authors": ["Joseph Teran", "Craig Schroeder", "Chenfanfu Jiang"], "published": "2016-03-20T07:37:01Z", "updated": "2016-03-20T07:37:01Z", "abstract": "We present a new technique for transferring momentum and velocity betweenparticles and grid with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) calculations which we callAffine-Particle-In-Cell (APIC). APIC represents particle velocities as locallyaffine, rather than locally constant as in traditional PIC. We show that thisrepresentation allows APIC to conserve linear and angular momentum acrosstransfers while also dramatically reducing numerical diffusion usuallyassociated with PIC. Notably, conservation is achieved with lumped mass, asopposed to the more commonly used Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) transferswhich require a 'full' mass matrix for exact conservation. Furthermore, unlikeFLIP, APIC retains a filtering property of the original PIC and thus does notaccumulate velocity modes on particles as FLIP does. In particular, wedemonstrate that APIC does not experience velocity instabilities that arecharacteristic of FLIP in a number of Material Point Method (MPM)hyperelasticity calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate that when combined withthe midpoint rule for implicit update of grid momentum that linear and angularmomentum are exactly conserved.", "categories": ["physics.comp-ph", "math.NA"], "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06188v1"}, "54": {"ID": 54, "title": "Geometric algebra and singularities of ruled and developable surfaces", "authors": ["Junki Tanaka", "Toru Ohmoto"], "published": "2018-08-31T03:33:21Z", "updated": "2018-08-31T03:33:21Z", "abstract": "Any ruled surface in Euclidean 3-space is described as a curve of unit dualvectors in the algebra of dual quaternions (=the even Clifford algebra of type(0,3,1)).

This preprocessing effort is often thedominant component of a typical clinical prediction project. In this work wepropose using semantic embedding methods to directly couple the raw, messyclinical data to downstream learning architectures with truly minimalpreprocessing. We examine this step from the perspective of capturing andencoding complex data dependencies in the data representation instead of in themodel, which has the nice benefit of allowing downstream processing to be donewith fast, lightweight, and simple models accessible to researchers withoutmachine learning expertise.
