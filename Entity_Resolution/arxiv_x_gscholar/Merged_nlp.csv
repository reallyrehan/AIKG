Several recent works tackle thisproblem, and propose methods for significantly reducing this gender bias inword embeddings, demonstrating convincing results. However, we argue that thisremoval is superficial. While the bias is indeed substantially reducedaccording to the provided bias definition, the actual effect is mostly hidingthe bias, not removing it. The gender bias information is still reflected inthe distances between ""gender-neutralized"" words in the debiased embeddings,and can be recovered from them.

We find that linear models trained on top of frozen contextualrepresentations are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific models inmany cases, but fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge(e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the transferability ofcontextual word representations, we quantify differences in the transferabilityof individual layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrentneural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance, higher layers of RNNsare more task-specific, while transformer layers do not exhibit the samemonotonic trend.

Our character-levelrecurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recoverunknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybridapproach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-basedones; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case ofword-based models.

The two sub models play a mini-max game and achieve the win-win situationwhen they reach a Nash Equilibrium.

RNN can utilize distributedrepresentations of words by first converting the tokens comprising each textinto vectors, which form a matrix. And this matrix includes two dimensions: thetime-step dimension and the feature vector dimension. Then most existing modelsusually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-basedoperation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector.However, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutuallyindependent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-stepdimension independently may destroy the structure of the featurerepresentation.

Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans uselanguage by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words,hierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than theirtraditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either thehierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisyusing soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extractingthe highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a fewsentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents thatare 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is veryimportant, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of adocument to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful formachine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencieswhile modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted NeuralSemantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmentedneural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novelhierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. Thequality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namelylemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improvedvocabulary coverage and generalization.

In many applications, these texts are limited in numbers,therefore their corresponding adversarial examples are often not diverse enoughand sometimes hard to read, thus can be easily detected by humans and cannotcreate chaos at a large scale.

To tacklethis problem, cross-lingual sentiment classification approaches aim to transferknowledge learned from one language that has abundant labeled examples (i.e.,the source language, usually English) to another language with fewer labels(i.e., the target language). The source and the target languages are usuallybridged through off-the-shelf machine translation tools. Through such achannel, cross-language sentiment patterns can be successfully learned fromEnglish and transferred into the target languages. This approach, however,often fails to capture sentiment knowledge specific to the target language, andthus compromises the accuracy of the downstream classification task. In thispaper, we employ emojis, which are widely available in many languages, as a newchannel to learn both the cross-language and the language-specific sentimentpatterns.

We call the resulting model the Gated End-to-End MemoryPolicy Network. More precisely, we use a model-free value-based algorithm tolearn policies for partially observed domains using this memory-enhanced neuralnetwork.

The cooling of the sample isconsidered as an alternative methodological approach to the experimentalinvestigation of the magnetized state of MAEs. The appearance of magneticanisotropy in MAE is associated with restructuring of the filler duringmagnetization, which leads to an additional effective field felt by themagnetization.

It is proposed thatthe experimentally observed large (about 40) ratio of the magnetic anisotropyconstant of the filler to the shear modulus of the matrix deserves attentionfor the explanation of magnetic and magnetoelastic properties of MAEs.

Recently this phenomenon has attracted lot of public attention,because it is causing significant social and financial impacts on their livesand businesses. Fake news are responsible for creating false, deceptive,misleading, and suspicious information that can greatly effect the outcome ofan event. This paper presents a synopsis that explains what are fake news withexamples and also discusses some of the current machine learning techniques,specifically natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning, forautomatically predicting and detecting fake news.
