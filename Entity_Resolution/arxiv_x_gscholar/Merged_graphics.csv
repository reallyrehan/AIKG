Pointclouds inherently lack topological information so designing a model to recovertopology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, wepropose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-basedhigh-level tasks on point clouds including classification and segmentation.EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. Itis differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared toexisting modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each pointindependently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates localneighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shapeproperties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space capturessemantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the originalembedding.

However, it is also a time-consuming and challenging task thatrequires advanced skills beyond the abilities of casual photographers. Using anautomated algorithm is an appealing alternative to manual work but such analgorithm faces many hurdles. Many photographic styles rely on subtleadjustments that depend on the image content and even its semantics. Further,these adjustments are often spatially varying. Because of thesecharacteristics, existing automatic algorithms are still limited and cover onlya subset of these challenges. Recently, deep machine learning has shown uniqueabilities to address hard problems that resisted machine algorithms for long.This motivated us to explore the use of deep learning in the context of photoediting. In this paper, we explain how to formulate the automatic photoadjustment problem in a way suitable for this approach. We also introduce animage descriptor that accounts for the local semantics of an image. Ourexperiments demonstrate that our deep learning formulation applied using thesedescriptors successfully capture sophisticated photographic styles.

Whileresearchers have investigated several methods to summarize, visualize or minethe data for analysis, first responders have not been able to fully leverageresearch advancements largely due to the gap between academic research anddeployed, functional systems. In this paper, we explore the opportunities andbarriers for the effective use of social media data from first responders'perspective. We present the summary of several detailed interviews with firstresponders on their use of social media for situational awareness. We furtherassess the impact of SMART-a social media visual analytics system-on firstresponder operations.","['cs.SI', 'cs.CY']",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07316v1,,
